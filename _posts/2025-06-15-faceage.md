In clinical practice, the doctor usually assesses the patient's health status or length of life on the basis of his or her face, state and subjective impressions.
** “Language of life”** - that is, the extent to which a person's physical ageing may reflect health status, therapeutic tolerance and survival expectations more than the actual age (year of birth). However, low-cost standardized biological age assessment tools are lacking.
The study developed **FaceAge** — an in-depth learning system using ** facial photos** to extrapolate “bioage” and to verify whether it can better predict the lifetime of cancer patients than traditional methods.
** Results of the study**

- **AI can accurately estimate “bioage”** through facial photographs and independently predict the lifetime of cancer patients.

- ** FaceAge is a better representative of the patient's state of health than the actual age** and the risk of death rises by about 15 per cent for each “looking old” age of 10 years.

- ** Cancer patients are on average 4.8 years older than their peers “looks older”, ** especially smokers are older in facial organisms.

- ** In terminal cancer palliative treatment, FaceAge improved the accuracy of doctors ' projections of six months of survival** AUC was raised from 0.74 to 0.80.

- **FaceAge is significantly associated with genes associated with cellular aging (e.g. CDK6),** showing its potential as a biomarker of “molecular aging”.

# I'll explain it in detail #

# 1. ** Model construction**

- Training and in-depth learning models with over 58,000 photographs using open data sets (IMDb-Wiki and UTKFace);

- The model structure is based on the **Inculation-ResNet v1** network, which begins with human face recognition and then returns to projected age.

# 2. **Clinical verification**
The model was validated in three clinical cancer patient data pools:

- MAASTRO

- Harvard Thoracic (pulmonary cancer)

- Harvard Palliative.

The facial photographs were taken from the site of the visit and were semi-standardly taken by medical personnel.

#3 ** Comparison and analysis**

- Comparison of FaceAge with real age and inclusion in multifactor survival analysis (Cox model);

- Comparison of the forecast results with the manual judgement of the doctor (including clinical information);

- Introduction of clinical risk scoring systems such as the **TEACHH model** to test FaceAge ' s ability to enhance its predictive effects;

- Analyzing whether FaceAge is statistically relevant to genes associated with ageing (e.g. CDK6).

# The core's found #

# 1. Patients "look older" #
In multiple cancer queues,** the risk of death has increased significantly for each “looks” 10 years old** (HR about 1.15) and is independent of the actual age, sex, and type of tumor.

- FaceAge is highly associated with the risk of death,** increased by 10 years for each “face biological age” and increased risk of death**:
MAASTRO queue: HR 1.151 (p = 0.013)

- Thoracic queue: HR 1.148 (p = 0.011)

- Palliative queue: HR 1.117 (p = 0.021)

** FaceAge has an independent predictive power in multiple cancer types (meat, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).

# 2. FaceAge is better than the doctor's subjective judgment and traditional age

- When predicting the six-month survival of cancer patients, **FaceAge models are superior to doctor's vision**;

- In integrating clinical models (e.g. TEACHH),** replacing age with FaceAge with model performance (AUC up to 0.80)**;

- FaceAge effects have remained stable in different cancer types, therapeutic intent (emission vs) and in the course of the disease.

Cox Multi-factor regression analysis:

- After controlling variables such as sex, cancer, therapeutic intent, phasing, PS rating, etc.:
** FaceAge still predicts a significant lifetime, while the actual age is no longer significant** (Thoracic queue: FaceAge p=0.011, age p=0.16).

- The inclusion of FaceAge in the model has resulted in a significant increase in model interpretation (log-likehood has increased significantly).

Substitution of the "age" variable in the TEACHH survival rating model:

- Risk scoring system ** Distinguishing between different life zones after replacing traditional age with FaceAge**:
The median survival of high-risk groups decreased (more precise): 0.21 vs 0.24 years;

- C-index (forecast consistency) has also increased.

#3. **FaceAge can assist doctors to make more accurate terminal predictions**
Experimental design:

- 100 photographs of terminal cancer patients for survival prediction missions (whether or not they have survived for more than six months):
Participants included oncologists, inpatients, non-clinical researchers;

- Provision of: photos only, photographs + medical records, photographs + medical records + FaceAge model outputs.

Results:

- AUC is about 0.61 when the doctor only looks at the photograph;

- Upgraded to 0.74 with medical records;

- Added to the FaceAge projection further up to **0.80 (p<0.0001)**;

- ** The accuracy of the doctor ' s predictions has improved significantly, especially for those with less basic judgement**

## 4. FaceAge is related to the aging-related molecular mechanisms

- FaceAge is significantly associated with cellular aging regulation of genes **CDK6**;

- The actual age is not statistically relevant to these genes**;

- Description: FaceAge not only captures visual information, but is more likely to reflect deep biological ageing mechanisms.

#5. ** The “face biological age” of cancer patients is about 4.8 years higher than that of ordinary people**

- FaceAge for cancer patients was found to be significantly older than their actual age compared to the healthy population (4.79 years more on average, p. < 0.0001);

- A consistent trend has been observed in the sub-groups of cancer, smoking status, BMI, ECOG performance rating, etc.;

- Current smokers FaceAge are about more than never smokers ** 33 months**, indicating that models are sensitive to lifestyle variables.

# Why is this research important?

# The value of clinical applications #

- **Quick, low-cost, non-intrusive**: only one photo of the face is required;

- Be suitable for such key options as “therapeutic treatment” and “how to treat” that are common in the clinical context;

- Providing more precise and objective assessments of survival and reducing errors resulting from subjective judgements;

- Possibilities to be used in **Clinical trial population stratification** and to improve the quality of research.

# The technology's innovative #

- For the first time, a systematic study was carried out on “mass biological age” as a medical predictor**;

- Models are validated from real, heterogeneous, multi-centric clinical queues;

- Interdisciplinary integration with AI technology and molecular biology.

# The limits and the challenges #

- ** Training data are not fully healthy or standardized** and there may be deviations (e.g. too many photographs of public figures);

- ** The capacity for trans-racial profiling** was not validated, although the model was initially tested in the multi-ethnic database;

- **Ethical and privacy risks**: facial data are extremely sensitive and should be carefully managed and regulated in the future;

- ** Not yet used in clinical practice**, requiring a larger number of central validations and regulatory clearances.
