**Pollo AI** is a **one-stop AI image and video generation platform** which integrates the most advanced models of AI globally (including Google Veo 3, Kling, Runway, Luma, Stable Diffusion, DALL E, etc.) and provides users with a variety of capabilities ranging from “text-to-video” to “image style”, “immolation generation”, “role coherence control”.

- All AI images and video large models (including Veo 3, Flux Kontext, GPT 4o-image) can be used here once and for all.

- We've got the raw map and the raw video stream.

The images and videos generated also support AI editing

- There's an infinite canvas that brings together AI's image generation + editor + canvas.

#  Main functional characteristics

# # The power of video generation #

- ** Text-to-Video**: Enter a text to quickly generate semantic, high-stylish video;

- ** Image-to-video**: upload a map to move the static image;

- **Video-style video**: turning reality video into Cyberbank, Disney, Miyazaki, etc.;

- **The role-convergence video**: Keeping the image, movement, style of the person constant and producing continuous footage.

# #  flexible image-generation capacity

- ** Text-generated images**: creation of detailed and well-structured AI images by prompt;

- ** Script style conversion**: oiling of photographs, changing of photographs, rewriting of different styles;

- ** Image enhancement, background **: image restoration, beautification, detail upgrade one step at a time.

- Image generation model support:
**DALL E**,**Imogen**,**Stable Diffusion**,**Ideogram**,**Recraft**,**FLUX series** et cetera;

- Support for text-shifting, image-enhanced, styled, redrawn, drawings, etc.

# Pollo API access advantages
** One stop access**

- All model API interface calls, significantly reducing integration costs;

- ** No separate connection or certification process is required for different models**

** Low cost**

- Pollo API ** lower prices, more models and more flexible use than platforms such as Fal.ai and Replicate**.

** Developer friendly**

# #  Price system (API Credit)
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/uxis95kybr1709ur16zpiul2j0im)每个模型的调用消耗 credit 不同，例如 Kling 1.6 生成 5s 视频仅需约 3.5 credits（约 $0.21），**显著低于同行价格**。
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/6bcgnn0p8kvx93pt211pw0eak8gt)Pollo AI 还是少数**获得 Google Cloud 合作授权的平台**，提供 Veo 3 模型 API 调用。Veo 3 可实现：

- Inclusion of personal dialogue and synchronized sound in the video;

- A more natural flow of lenses and performances;
