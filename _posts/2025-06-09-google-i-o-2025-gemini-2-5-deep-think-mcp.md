#Gemini 2.5 Pro: A fully upgraded general model

♪ ♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

- **Advanced academic and practical capacity**:
Take the highest ELO rating 1415 (website development task) in **WebDev Arena** row;

- Multiple dimensions are at the top of the human preference rating for **LMARENA**;

**1 million token context window**:

- Support complex multiple rounds of dialogue, lengthy document processing, video-by-college understanding.

# # The preferred model of the educational scene #

- Integration of LearnLM (trained in collaboration with educational experts):
(b) Be better at explaining knowledge and guiding learning;

- Beyond competitions such as GPT-4 and Claude in teaching dialogue, human evaluation.

- Become one of the most appropriate generic models for learning and teaching scenes at present.

# Deep Think: Experimental "Deep Thinking" mode

# # # high-level logic #

- **Deep Think** is a new experimental feature of Gemini 2.5 Pro, supporting the model “Multi-supposition parallel reasoning”, simulating multi-path thinking before answering;

- The following outstanding tasks have been carried out:
**USAMO 2025** (American Mathematics Olympics): leading results;

- **LiveCodeBench** (Code Capability Competition Task): ranked first;

- **MMMU** (multimodular reasoning): Accuracy **84.0%**.

# The current state #

- To “trusted developers” only;

- More rigorous security assessments are under way and gradual liberalization is expected in the future.

# Gemini 2.5 Flash: Light and efficient "AI tool motor"

♪ ♪ Faster, cheaper, smarter ♪

- Design objectives: ** Low delay + High throughput + Low cost **;

- Full speed in reasoning, multimodel processing, long text tasks;

- Token use reduction **20-30%**, significantly reducing reasoning costs.

# # Use the channel #

- Developmenters and the public have been made available through Google AI Studio, Vertex AI and Gemini App.

# Original audio capacity: Dialogue is more natural and emotional

# # New feature bright spot #

- **Native Audio Output**:
Support natural voice generation, control tone, emotions, speech style;

- Fitting 24+ languages to support seamless transliteration of multiple languages;

**Text-to-Speech (TTS) upgrade**:

- Producing two-fold voice for dialogue, softly nuanced, emotional ups and downs;

**Live API Extension**:

- **Affective Dialogue**: recognition of user sentiment and matching of feedback;

- **Proactive Audio**: Auto-shield background noise, smart judgement whether to respond.


# Project Mariner: Let Gemini control your computer

# The key power #

- The ability to introduce “simulating human manipulation computers”: clicking, filling in forms, web interaction;

- The following enterprises have been tested in cooperation:
**Automation Anywhere, UiPath, Browserbase, etc.**;

More API test privileges will be opened to developers during the summer.

# I've got a lot of security upscaling

# To defend against new attacks #

- Gemini 2.5 significantly enhance protection against “**Indirect Injection”**;

- Enhancement of the system ' s robustness in the use of tools through new testing mechanisms;

- It's currently Google's safest version of the model.

Google has also added to Gemini API the original SDK support for the definition of the model context protocol (MCP) to allow easier integration with open source tools.
