Figma released a series of new heavy-pound features at the Conference in 2025, designed in five areas: ** handwriting, responsive layout, brand asset management, website posting, AI prototype generation**, and significantly increased the efficiency of creative expression and collaborative fluidity.

# # 1. **Figma Draw**: Design as freely as painting

- Supports ** vector drawing in hand-drawn style**, addition of brushes, fillings, rough controls, etc.

- ** Width, volatilization, repeat frequency of the free control line**

- Allow designers to express their personality like pens in vector tools.

Detailed description of function:

- **Liberal brush control**: supports lines of varying size, frequency and volatility.

- ** Style custom**: can adjust the line 'wiggle', quality, brush style.

- ** pattern fill (pattern fill)**: maintain pattern consistency and do not need to be copied.

- Prototype sketching

- Hand-drawn wind.

- Custom icons

- Rapid mind storm sketches.

Highlights:

- Traditional vector tools are better suited to “strict structures”, and Figma Draw offers the possibility of “free expression”.

- Designers can use the same tool for the back-to-back switch of Adobe Illustrator + Figma.

##  2. **Griddy Up (grid system)**: Responsive layout is stronger

- The real grid properties can be viewed in development mode through **CSS Grid**.

- Supports ** all key parameters such as number of custom columns, spacing, margin**.

- Design and development of a genuine “breakless connection”.

Detailed description of function:

- ** Supports the CSS Grid property preview**: When the designer sets the grid, the developers can view the equivalent code in Dev Mode directly, such as grid-template-columns.

- ** Fully customized grid rules**: number of columns, column width, spacing, margin, fit screen size, etc.

grid-template-colomns: repeat(3,1fr);
Gap: 24px;
Padding: 24px;

# #  # # # # # where the scene is:

- Enterprise/government/education multi-column page design

- High-maintainable design system development

- Workstream more closely aligned with front-end development

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

- For the first time, the design tool introduces ** Front-end original grid grid layout** language, without design  development of communication to explain directly " code against sign " .

##  3. **Figma Buzz**: Brand asset tool for teamwork

- Team members can generate, edit and publish ** tens of thousands of brand materials in bulk.

- **Competence control**: Define which elements can be modified to ensure brand unity.

## 4. **Figma Setes**: Design + Release Integrated Station Platform

- A responsive website can be designed and published directly in Figma**.

- Provides a rich template to support drag-and-pull puzzles and access without code.

## 5. **Figma Make (**AI prototype generator**): from hint to application of prototype
It allows users to directly transform ideas or existing designs into ** functional prototypes, web applications or interactive UI** through a natural language dialogue (Prompt).

- Enter a sentence, such as "Create a coffee order applet", and Figma automatically generates the design sketch.

- Supports a variety of Prompts, such as the addition of animations, the generation of musical players UI, 3D card interactions, etc.

- ** Results can be modified and fine-tuned directly** to ensure flexibility.

Detailed description of function:

- **Prompt Create UI**:
Enter, for example, " Create a task management application " , which automatically generates an interface.

** Interactive capacity support**:
