Google officially launched a new upgrade on I/O 2025** for the developers to provide a stronger AI primary development platform. This update significantly enhanced the usability, integration and ease of deployment of the Gemini model by creating the "** one-stop AI App Build Platform** " .

# Core update bright spots

## 1. **Native Code Generation**

- Introduction of a code editor **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to Studio to support the direct generation of text/image/video tips for Web applications;

- Add **Build Tab**: Accelerant-based web application (support to deployment of one key to Claude Run) can be built and deployed quickly;

- Support for iterative development: you can change the code, see the diff, return the historical version in the chat dialogue.

##2. **The Media Generation Centre (Generate Media)**

- Integration **Imogen (image)**,**Veo (video)**,** Lyria (music)** and Gemini (text) multi-model capacity;

- New interactive music generation App: PromptDJ, based on Lyria RealTime.

##3.** Audio capability upgrade: more natural, more responsive**

# Gemini 2.5 Flash supported Native Voice Dialogue (Live API):

- Support for **30 multiple natural persons** (male and female, accent, emotional)

- Introduction of ** active audio recognition**: a model that distinguishes between a user ' s speech and background noise and responds only at the appropriate time;

- Fits more closely to the rhythm of human natural dialogue and applies to such scenes as customer service, virtual assistants, interactive dramas, etc.


# #  Text-to-Speech (TTS) upgrade:

- Single-person or multi-person dialogue generation;

- Support for multidimensional control of speech speed, tone and emotions;


#Agentic and Tool Ecology

- ** Add a new `Build' tab** to create a Gemini application prototype from text, image or video prompt to integrate the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

- ** Smart Code Assistant** supports the editing of existing application codes, viewing differences (diff), rollback history versions.

- **Step one key to Cloud Run** to automatically host Gemini API Key to the production environment without the need to configure the server.

- **The new "Generate Media" page** focuses on multi-model models such as Imogen (image), Veo (video), voice generation, etc.

- ** Supports the MCP (Model Context Protocol)** primary integrated open source standard, which facilitates the construction of complex AI application and docking third-party tools.

- **URL Context experimental function** Models can read the content of web links for summary, match, research and verification.

# 1. **New "Build" tab: extremely simple generation from prompt to App**

- The new Build panel set up as a **Gemini 2.5 Pro** model

- Closely co-ordinated with Google's **Genai SDK**

- Supports the direct generation of application prototypes from text, images or videos

- Auto-generated UI+ functional code (fit for front end or full-store prototype)


#  2. ** Code helper functionality online: support version comparison and withdrawal**

- AI-assisted modifications can be made to existing projects

- Provide "see change" capability

- Support back to the historical version (checkpoint mechanism)

- Significant improvements in multi-person collaboration and version control efficiency


#  3. ** Key deployed to Cloud Run: zero-wire AI App Production**

- Upon completion of the application build, direct deployment to Google Cloud Run

- Gemini API Key will automatically save it on the service end and improve security.

- Enable developers to move prototypes to the online environment for use


#  4. **New "Generate Media" page: integration of all multi-model model capabilities**

- Centralized access and use:
Imogen (image generation)

- Veo (video generation)

- Gemini (language + trans-model production)

-Native speech model (voice generation)

One-stop call multi-module modeling, adapted to applications of creativity, education, content, etc.

#  5. ** Support for MCP standards: Enhanced Ecocompatibility**

- Google Genai SDK Current Support MCP Protocol

- Access to open source tools and third-party frameworks

- Provision of standard interfaces for the construction of complex dialogue systems or multi-model interactive applications

# 6. ** Experimental function: URL Context, let model read web page**

- Users can directly enter web links

- Web content available at Gemini for:
Fact-checking

- Executive summary

- Information comparison.

- Academic or business-level research scenes
