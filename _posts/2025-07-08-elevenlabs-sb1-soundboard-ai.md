- Simple operation, web-based, without the need for installation;

- Integrating AI sound generation and high creative flexibility;

- Multi-speakable simultaneous broadcast, suitable for a rich simulation of the scene;

- Storage, classification and customization to facilitate long-term content management;

# Core function details

- ** Text to Audio Generation (Text-to-SFX)**
The user can generate sound effects through a description of the text, for example by entering " thunder in a storm " or " sci-fi laser fire " , and SB-1 will use AI to generate the corresponding audio clips.

- Support for multilingual descriptions, including in English, Japanese (e.g., “synthetic linguization”) and so on, which enhances the accessibility of users worldwide.

- Sound generated can be played in real time, looped or saved as preset to facilitate reuse.

** Drummers and environmental noise generation**

- SB-1 is not limited to a single sound, but can also generate rhythm drums (drum machine) and persistent environmental sound (e.g. white noise, forest sound) as ideal tools for music production or video sounding.

Environmental class (Ambient): sound of rain, thunder, flame, wind, bug, etc.;
