**Oakley Meta HSTN** Smart sports glasses, launched by Meta in collaboration with Oakley, combines the advanced artificial intelligence technology (AI)** with the design of sports glasses** designed to provide new experiences for athletes and sports fans.
This product combines Oakley's iconic motion design, advanced optical technology and Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) functionality, integrating a variety of functions, such as **AI assistant**, ** high-resolution camera**, ** Audio play** and ** Sport data analysis**, to help athletes better understand their performance and enhance their training effectiveness.

## ** Core functions and characteristics**:
1. **AI Assistant Integration**:

- **Meta AI**: The glasses are embedded with Meta's assistant, and athletes can interact with them by voice commands. For example, when you play golf, you can say, "Hey, Meta, how's the wind going today?" AI will tell you how the wind speed changes and help you make better shot decisions.

- ** Record video**: You can also make video easily by voice command, for example, "Hey, Meta, take a video." So you can easily record your sports moments.

- **Voice control**: Meta AI is built to support the silent voice command, and users can awaken by “Hey Meta” and perform the following:
Query for real-time information, such as weather, wind speed, wave state or game rules (particularly useful for athletes).

- Sending messages or calling (support for WhatsApp, Messenge, etc.).

- Photographs/videos or live broadcasts to social platforms.

- Provision of real-time translation (support for multilingualism, suitable for travel or international events).

- Visual description function: a description of the surrounding environment for users with visual impairments, such as objects, colours or text.

** Limitations**: AI functions rely on cloud connections and require a stable Wi-Fi or mobile data network.
2. ** High-quality video and audio play**:

- **3K high-quality camera**: built-in cameras can shoot **3K super-high-quality** videos documenting every great moment of your motion and sharing them with your friends through glasses.

- **Open earphone speaker**:
** Design**: Open headphone technology, integrated into mirror legs, providing music, podcast or call experience through targeted audio, while maintaining an environmental perception (critical for outdoor sportsmen).

- ** Audio**: Supports high-fibre audio, suitable for lower-sounding or clear communication in motion.

- ** Five micro arrays: ** Optimizing voice interaction, video recording and voice recording, with noise-reducing capabilities appropriate to the noise environment (e.g. outdoor exercise or urban commute). Ensure that Meta AI accurately recognizes voice commands and captures clear environmental sound or conversation during video recording.

3. ** Strong visual experience**:

- **PrizMTM Lens technology**: These glasses are uniquely owned by Oakley **PrizMTM mirror technology** that enhances color contrasts and visual clarity. Especially under different light or weather conditions, this technology helps you see more details and reacts more quickly. For example, little details on the field or ice reflections during skiing.

- **12MP ultra wide-angle camera**
**Resolution**: Supports video recording up to 3K (2880 x 1620), significantly better than Ray-Ban Meta's 1080p (1920 x 1080).

- ** Video duration**: A single recording of up to three minutes is appropriate to capture critical moments in motion, such as skiing, surfing or running.

- ** Photo and video management**: Through MetaView applications, users can transmit the film directly to smartphones, quickly edit and share it on social platforms (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook).

- **Application scene**: Athletes can record first-view (POV) videos, and daily users can film segments of their lives or use them for accessibility (e.g. description of the environment for persons with visual impairments).

4. ** Sport design**:

- **Waterproof design**: Glasses have **IPX4 waterproofing levels**, which means that they can be used during rainy days or sweating and are suitable for various extremes of motion.

- ** Comfort wear**: Oakley combines body engineering design to ensure that glasses are comfortable and do not affect sports performance.

- **Touch and key operation**
** Touch-controlled panel**: mirror leg side supports slide and click operations to adjust volume, play/suspension media or activate AI assistants.

- **Physics button**: for quick start shoot or switch functions suitable for fast action in motion.

- **Intuitive design**: Tact control and keying combined to reduce learning costs and fit for high-intensity sports scenes.

5. **Long-acting batteries and fast charge**:

- ** 8 hours **: One charge can support continuous use ** 8 hours ** and even long sports can meet demand.

- **19-hour waiting period**: even if not used, glasses can be held for **19 hours**.

- ** Quick charge**: charge **50% in 20 minutes so you can quickly restore the power and continue to use it.
