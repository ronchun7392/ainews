Against the background of the progressive saturation of the traditional Code Assistant, Google is officially launched;**Jules** is positioned as a “virtual programming partner who can really work independently” rather than as a simple code auto-filling tool.
Jules is not just giving you advice, but ** carrying out the full development task independently**, representing the official exit from the laboratory of the “agent development” towards practicalization.

# Jules, what is it?
**Jules is a step-by-step, autonomous AI programming intelligence** with access to your real code warehouse,** running in a cloud-end independent environment** for the following tasks:

- Auto-generated test cases

- Fix code defects (bugs)

- Upgrade dependent version (e.g. Node.js)

- Build new functional modules

- Provide audio changelog

# Six key features of Jules

# 1.  ** Real code library processing**

- ** Unlike sandbox tools**, Jules has access to existing real projects, read the global context, cross-document/module architecture, dependency and logical structure;

- The ability to make precise structural adjustments to existing works, such as module re-engineering or version migration.

##2. **ParlExécution**

- All tasks run on Google Cloud VM;

- Support** for parallel execution of multiple requests** and significant acceleration of multitask processing, applicable to the CI/CD, re-engineering, etc. heavy load process.

#3.  ** Visualized workflow**

- Prior to implementation, Jules will present the developers with his plan (the logic of the plan + the reason for the change);

- Users may first assess their operational motives to ensure that the quality of the code is not affected by “black box decision-making”.

## 4.  **GitHub seamlessly**

- Jules is embedded in the GitHub workflow and does not require platform login or additional configuration;

- can trigger AI assistant operations directly against the context of PR, committee, issue etc.

#5. **User Steelability**

- Developers may ** freely adjust the content, modalities or results of the implementation of AI in the pre-medium and post-stages**;

- Ensure that the ownership of the code remains in human hands and meets the needs of team compliance/review.

#6.  **Audio Summeries**

- Conversion of code submission history to **voicechangelog**;

- Fits for multiple scenarios such as project review, team synchronization, voice broadcast, etc.

# Working mechanisms and core competencies

# #  understand context, smart action**

- Cloning your code warehouse to Google Cloud security virtual machine (VM);

- Retrieving the complete context of the project, not on the basis of a single document or sandbox;

- Understanding the structure and intent of the code, reasoning and implementing changes.

# # # # # run # # run # # run # # run # # by # # # by # # # by # # by # # by # # by # # by # # by # # by # # by # # by # by # # by # by # by # # by # by # # by # # by # by # # by # by # by #

- You don't have to keep an eye on it;

- Jules is on the backstage and is on mission and, upon completion, provides a description** of the plan, justification and discrepancy (diff)**.

# #  ** Data privacy protection**

- Default private ownership of all operations;

- Private codes will not be used for model training;

- The data is completely isolated from the VM operating environment.

# ** Global Open Commons** (Gemini model available country);

- Free trial without waiting for a list (with a ceiling on use);

- Follow-up will introduce payment mechanisms;

- Use of document address: https://jules.google/docs/useage-mits/
