Microsoft has developed a system called **MAI-DxO** to enable AI to conduct diagnostics step by step as a true doctor**, including questions, examinations, analyses of results, and ultimately to determine the cause of the disease, rather than to give a direct answer.
It simulates multiple doctors working together, progressively reasoning and accurately diagnosing complex cases. It combines the advantages of different AI models and works together to accomplish diagnostic tasks.

# What's so good about it?

- **More accurate**: It is easier to diagnose complex and difficult diseases than doctors, with a success rate of up to 85 per cent.

- ** Save more money**: It won't give you a bunch of useless checks, it'll ** cost itself** and it'll save more money and be more efficient.

- ** More like a doctor**: Not a single answer, but, "Think about it and ask questions and analyze it step by step."

- ** Federation consultations:** It's actually a lot of AIs (like GPTs, Claudes)** combined to work**, like a few doctors discussing it together, it's very comprehensive.

Microsoft sent AI to “challenge” the real cases in 304 medical journals, which resulted in a diagnostic correctness rate of **85%** and a professional doctor on average **20%**. This is a big difference!

What's the advantage over a doctor?

# **MAI-DxO Detailed Functions and Characteristics**:
** Five virtual doctor role co-diagnosis (Panel of Virtual Doctors)**
MAI-DXO is not a single AI model, but** a system that coordinates multiple AI models**, simulates collaboration between doctors, forming a virtual “doctor team”. This team has different roles and has different tasks:
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/1th4slfqozl2vvi3omkkw5fpvued)每个“医生”角色根据自己的职责，提出建议并进行讨论，最终做出决定。这种方法通过**多轮决策**来模拟医生如何在有限的信息下不断收集证据、提出新问题、下达检查指令，直到最终确认诊断。

- ** Three decision-making steps**:
** Question**: AI raised issues related to patients' symptoms, history, etc.

- ** Inspection**: AI requires the corresponding diagnostic tests (e.g. CT, blood tests, etc.) based on the reasoning.

- ** Diagnosis**: AI gives the diagnosis after sufficient evidence has been accumulated.

# **1. Multimodel teamwork**

- ** Multi-AI model collaboration**: MAI-DxO is not a single AI model, but rather a coordinating device that combines several basic language models (e.g. GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)** to work.

- These AI models, like doctors in different fields “discussion cases” together, can be reasoned and decision-making on different aspects.

MAI-Dx Orchestrator can transform any language model into a virtual clinical team of specialists: it can ask follow-up questions, arrange tests or diagnoses, then conduct a cost check and validate its reasoning, and finally decide whether to proceed.

# 2. Progressive Diagnosis**

- ** Progressive diagnosis**: MAI-DxO does not rely solely on a one-time diagnosis, but rather on a “step-by-step reasoning” approach.

- For example: if the patient says there is coughing and fever, MAI-DxO first considers whether it is cold and then requests blood tests, X-rays, etc., to identify the cause of the disease.

# 3. Cost-benefit analysis (Cost-Efficiency)**

- ** Cost awareness**: MAI-DxO can automatically assess the cost of each step during the diagnostic process and make ** more economical** decisions. It does not blindly require all tests, but weighs the relationship between diagnostic accuracy and cost.

- This is important for reducing unnecessary medical expenses and avoiding excessive examinations, especially in cost-intensive health systems.

# **4. Self-censorship and validation**

- ** Self-censorship**: Whenever MAI-DxO makes a reasoning or diagnosis, it performs ** self-certification** to check whether it is reasonable and adjusted.

#  5. Simulation team**

- ** Virtual doctor team**: MAI-DxO is more than a “single expert”, which simulates ** multiple doctors** (different professional backgrounds) working together to solve problems. It is designed like a virtual doctor team, with various diagnostic methods complementing each other, forming a diverse decision-making process.

- **Modular coordination**: This coordination mechanism enables MAI-DxO to combine several different reasoning models to enable it to make the best judgement in complex situations.

# **MAI-DxO effects and performance**
MAI-DxO has demonstrated very strong performance in a series of rigorous assessments, particularly in complex diagnostic missions, as follows:
**1. Performance in diagnostic accuracy**:

- **85.5% Accuracy**: in comparison with 304 NEJM cases (New England Medical Journal), MAI-DxO paired with OpenAI o3, the diagnostic accuracy rate in these complex cases was **85.5%**.

- ** Comparison of the performance of doctors**: In the same mission, the average accuracy of 21 experienced doctors (United States and British doctors with 5 to 20 years of clinical experience) was only **20 per cent**, well below that of MAI-DxO.

- And MAI-DxO upgraded all the models on the 304 cases.

**2. Performance in cost efficiency**:

- MAI-DXO not only has accurate diagnosis, but can also do ** lower costs. ** In traditional medical examinations, doctors may do more tests for fear of leaks, while MAI-DXO can ** reduce unnecessary testing ** and thus reduce the total cost of diagnosis.

**3. Strong** Resource management capacity**:

- ** Cost-benefit balance**: MAI-DxO has a cost control function that reasonably controls costs on the basis of assurance of diagnostic accuracy.

- This capacity is very important, especially in environments where resources are limited, medical costs are significant or large numbers of cases need to be handled.

**4. Model collaboration**:

- **The strengths of multiple models**: Through collaboration between different AI models, MAI-DxO is able to provide more comprehensive and accurate diagnostic results using the strengths of different models in the ** complex diagnostic tasks**.

By showing the accuracy and cost of different AI systems, the chart above helps us to understand which systems (e.g. MAI-DxO) are accurate and cost-effective in their diagnosis, far beyond the performance of doctors and single AI models.

# MAI-DxO shows remarkable results, especially in:

- ** High-precision** diagnostics and ** cost-effectiveness**, far beyond traditional manual diagnostics.

- Its** multi-model collaboration** and** self-certification** capabilities give it a clear advantage in the resolution of complex cases.

Nevertheless, MAI-DxO still needs more ** clinical validation** and ** physical environmental testing**, especially in the diagnosis of common daily diseases. It is still in the ** research phase** and will need more scrutiny in terms of safety and compliance in the future.

# The strengths and limitations of MAI-DXO**

# 1. ** Strength**

- **The balance between accuracy and cost**: MAI-DxO can significantly reduce the cost of diagnosis without sacrificing accuracy.

- ** Simulation team**: Individual deviations and errors in premature conclusions were avoided through the collaboration of multiple virtual physician roles.

- ** Efficient information extraction**: Through ** step-by-step consultation, testing**, the system is able to efficiently tap valuable information and avoid redundant operations.

- **Enhancing weak model performance**: By coordinating multiple roles, MAI-DxO helps weaker models to improve their reasoning and reduce the rate of misdiagnosis.

## 2. ** Limitations**

- ** Special case priority**: Current experimental data from the most challenging **NEJM cases** do not represent routine common cases and it is therefore not possible to verify the performance of MAI-DxO in common diseases.

- ** Failure to address the emotional and ethical problems of patients**: MAI-DxO focuses on diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness, and lacks the emotional, ethical or communication treatment of patients.

- **Global Difference**: Cost estimates are based mainly on United States prices and do not reflect the actual costs of different health systems globally.

#3. ** Outlook for the future**

- ** Adaptation to common diseases**: MAI-DxO's performance in common diseases, especially under ** low-resource environment**, will be validated in the future.

- **Integration of more medical data**: Integrating imaging data, genome information, etc. could be considered to further improve accuracy.

- **Clinical practical application**: The future can be integrated with the clinical environment and extended to areas such as smart consultations, intelligent assistants, etc.
