On I/O 2025, Google announced that its search experience would move from traditional information retrieval to the "intellectual response age".
By integrating the **Gemini 2.5 model**, GoogleSearch officially launched a stronger **AI Mode**, giving search more in-depth reasoning, real-time interaction, personalized analysis and multidimensional capabilities such as automatic task processing.

# # more intelligent question-and-answer experience**

- Supporting complex, multi-wheel, multi-model questions;

- There are not only answers but also web links to help users explore further;

- Through the **query fan-out mechanism**, the issue is automatically deconstructed into multiple sub-references and an in-depth search for a wider web resource;

- Integration **Gemini 2.5 customized version**, enhancing understanding, responsiveness accuracy and logical structure.

## **DeepSearch: Auto-generated expert-level studies**

- AI Mode can initiate hundreds of automatic searches for complex queries (e.g. essay studies, technical subjects);

- Aggregation, reasoning and formation of ** fully quoted in-depth reports**, saving several hours of research time;

- Fits for higher education, business research and academic exploration.


#  Multimodels and real-time interactions: search for real "visible"

# #  **Search Live: camera real-time visual question-and-answer**

- Integration **Project Astra** capabilities, with users interacting with AI via camera;

- Support for “see and ask”: photographing a device, plant or street view, AI real-time feedback explaining and linking;

- May be used as a learning tool, travel assistant or trouble recognition assistant.

- For example: search for “The Music and Food Events at Nashville this weekend”, AI makes personal recommendations in relation to the preferences of the user's restaurant, the booking of tickets and the location of accommodation;

- All information use processes** are self-controlled by users** and personal data access can be activated/deactivated at any time.

#  Custom chart and data analysis

- AI Mode can automatically generate charts based on specific questions (e.g. comparison of the success rate of the two baseball teams);

- Support the visualization of real-time data in areas such as sports, finance, etc.

**AI Mode is fully online in the United States** and does not need to join the Labs experiment;
New features (e.g. DeepSearch, Search Live, Smart Agent) will be introduced in phases over the next few weeks, with Labs users giving priority to experience;
Users can switch to the " AI Mode " tab on Google App or on a search page.
