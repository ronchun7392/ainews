- Traditional antibodies have found that they rely on animal immunization or large-scale library screening, are inefficient, costly and ineffective for some hard-core targets.

- Existing AI antibody design methods (e.g. RFdiffusion) are generally below 0.1% hit rate (hit rate) and difficult to separate from high flux screening.

The Chai Discovery team released a new AI model called **Chai-2** for the design of antibody molecules (** antibody is used to combat the pharmaceutical composition of viruses, cancers, etc.)** which is a special protein commonly used in medicine and biotechnology.
The key features of Chai-2 are zero-species learning (zero-shot) and high hit-rate design, leading to major breakthroughs in the field of antibody design.
That is, the model does not require a large amount of training data input for each new antibody design target. It can understand and design a new antibody “from scratch” and it can produce an effective antibody through the knowledge available if a target protein is given.
Using multi-module-generated structures, it achieves a zero-species antibody design in conjunction with atomic-grade structural prediction and modelling. Chai-2 can use only two weeks to complete a complete process from target setting to molecular generation, synthesis and validation, with a fatal rate of more than 15%, well above industry standards. The result shows that molecular engineering is moving from an empirical approach to a controlled, determinative generation strategy.
** Where is it? **

- ** There is no need for repeated experiments**: the traditional antibody design is wrong, and they can design many effective molecules with one input.

- ** Super-efficient**: It could have taken months or even years to do it, and they could have done it in two weeks** (exceeding 100 times).

- ** Good hit rate**: 50 targets tested and eventually more than 15% of molecules "hit" successfully, already high.

- ** 68% experimental hit rate in Miniprotein design** and picoolar affinity.

- ** AI can do it **: They use a very advanced AI system that doesn't just understand the structure of molecules, but is designed to “think for itself”.

** Application and vision for the future**

- It is expected that a demand-driven **table-specific combination** will facilitate the rapid development of complex therapies such as dual-specific antibodies, antibody drug puppets, etc.

- Support for the design of non-traditional biological drugs such as **cyclopyridium, enzymes, small molecules**, etc.

- Working towards the transformation of biology into “engineering” — moving from empirical discovery to ** controlled, programmable molecular design**.

# Chai-2 model

# # model structure

- ** Multimodular All-Toom General Model**

- Two core submodules:
Chai-2d: Design submodules for the direct generation of antibody sequences and structures from target proteins and tables.

- Chai-2f: Collapse module for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins and assessing combined quality.

** Global Atomic Level Design**: Consider not only amino acid sequences, but also complementarities between the space structure and the atomic stages of the interface

# #  supports multiple design formats

- VHH (uni-domain antibodies)

- scFv (single-chain variable fragments)

- Mini protein (non-antibodies but small proteins that combine the target)

# Activate bright

# Experimental results and evaluation
Using a one-time input of 50 targets, Chai-2 produces molecules with an experimental hit rate of over 15 per cent, the entire process takes only 2 weeks and does not require an iterative optimisation or high flux screening.

# # # antibody design mission #
Experimental settings:

- 52 completely new target proteins (no active antibody records)

- Design and test up to 20 antibodies per target (scFv or VHH format)

- Experimental method: Bio-Layer Interferomery (BLI) to determine integration capacity and filiation (KD)

![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/973noy1gb5dcasbv27fbonmecct9)
- Upgrade ** above two orders of magnitude** compared to the traditional antibody generation method (<0.1% mean rate).

- All designs are validated only through an experimental cycle** and do not require an iterative screening.

# Mini-protein design mission #

- Target number: 5 including PD-L1, IL7Ra, InsulinR, PDFBR beta and TNF alpha.

- Experiment: 20-25 mini proteins per target designed and measured using BLI.

Examples of hits and filiation:

- Average hit rate** > 68%**

- TNF-α is a highly difficult-structured target designed to hit the first successful AI.

# Why do they have such a high success rate?
Because Chai-2:

- ** Not only design structure, but also predict effects**: it is not a guess, but a combination of three-dimensional structure simulations and screening.

- ** Can design different types of antibodies**: include common small antibodies (scFv), camel antibodies (VHH), miniproteins, etc.

- ** Control details**: The location of the target, the antibody style can be specified, and even the antibody (cross-species design) can be designed for both humans and animals**.

# Let's give a few examples:

Case 1 against TNF-α (a very difficult target)

- TNF-α has a complex structure and has never been successfully designed by AI.

- Chai-2 designed antibody ** successfully glued to it ** and was first achieved!

Case 2: antibody "double version" design

- For the same target protein (CCL2), Chai-2 designed two antibodies (scFv and VHH) in different locations, and both succeeded **!

Case 3: Trans-species antibodies

- Scientists allow Chai-2 to design the same protein that combines humans and monkeys.

- The result was indeed achieved: the antibody capacity was designed to “stuck” the target protein for both species.

# What else do they do to ensure that the antibodies are “reliable”?

-  One-size-fits-all examination**: Antibodies stick only to the target to which they should stick, and not to the proteins.

- **Safety indicators**: AI will assess in advance whether the design is likely to trigger an immuno-response (immunosis).

- **Stability assessment**: Vulnerability to variability or agglomeration is a matter of availability.
