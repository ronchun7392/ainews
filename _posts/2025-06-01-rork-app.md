Rork 1.0 is an innovative tool that allows users to build, test, share and publish mobile applications quickly, with little need for programming experience.
The slogan is "From ideas to mobile applications, only a few minutes" and the goal is to automatically convert user applications into deployable mobile applications through AI.
The platform helps users to create a fully functional APP without programming experience** by using **React Native** (a cross-platform mobile development framework maintained by Facebook), combined with the logic, interface and functionality generated by AI.

- Open Rork, enter what you want to do with App's ideas, like, "An application to record daily moods."

- It's ** Auto-generated interfaces, functions, logic**

- You can add pictures, buttons, input boxes... you just need a few points.

- The user only needs to provide a short application description, and the system will automatically understand your needs and generate a full code.

- Support the simultaneous construction of cross-platforms (iOS and Android).

- All applications generate a full code for "**can be used in the production environment**".

- Supports export source code customizing or uploading App Store/Google Play.

# ** Principal features and functions:**
** In a matter of minutes, from creativity to application**

- Quick build: just enter an idea, Rork generates a mobile application.

- Figma Import: A fast prototype design that supports the direct import of Figma files.

- Sharing functionality: applications are shared directly through links without the need for App Store.

3. ** Generate AI applications**

- Direct generation of AI applications based on GPT models using Claude 4: API keys or documents are not required.

- Rapid generation: create a " single generation " application using GPT 4o API.

4. ** Strong backend and security support**

- Support backend databases such as Supabase, Firebase, Airtable, and ensure security and accessibility through the TRC and server structures.

- Without manual code, just fill in interfaces or select databases

- Rork automatically converts each of your operations into a complete code logic and deploys it.

5. **Simulator and equipment support**

- Android simulator: Simulate the original Android device directly in the browser without Android Studio or Gradle.

- iOS support: iOS emulator is about to be launched.

6. **New functionality and forthcoming content**
