**Google officially publishes Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro models,** which can now be used by any developer to construct and expand the AI applications that can be put into production.

- **In parallel with the launch of the new model Gemini 2.5** ** Flash-Lite (prevary version)**:
This is the fastest-response and least-cost model in the Gemini 2.5 series.

- Particularly applicable to practical applications where low-delayed and efficient responses are required.

#  Details of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite

1. The most cost-effective and fastest.

- Compared to the Pro model,** the reasoning is faster and less costly**.

- Lower than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash ** Delay** and faster reasoning;

- The cost of each call is significantly reduced and suitable for deployment in large-scale systems or user scenarios.

- Light solutions for ** edge devices, mobile terminals, microservices**.

2. Quality enhancement in basic tasks
Flash-Lite overstepped the old version on several standard tests:

- ** Code generation**

- **Mathematic/logical reasoning**

- **The scientific understanding mission**

- ** Text/image multi-model input parsing**

The performance is more balanced and comprehensive than 2.0 Flash-Lite.

#3 3. Support Gemini 2.5 full functionality
These include:
1. **Controllable Thinking**
Gemini 2.5 Flash is one of the first models to support "thinking about the budget":

- Users can set a reasoned calculation budget (e.g. the Token number) with a flexible trade-off between response speed and accuracy.

- Models can use more forward transmission steps to improve accuracy when dealing with complex tasks (e.g. mathematical questions, code generation).

2. ** Multi-module treatment**
Although not pro-version, it still has the full range of original multi-model support:

- Type of input includes: text, image, audio, video.

- Capable of processing **hour video content**, structured images (e.g. graphs, UI interfaces) and voice.

- Support the task of extracting events, identifying scenes, generating applications or summaries from videos.

3. **Tool-use**: for example, to call Google search, code run, etc., and have **million token context window**, the same level as Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro.

#  4. ** Performance comparison**:

2.5 Flash-Lite is a full leader in response speed, reasoning quality compared to the old version 2.0 Flash-Lite and Flash.

- Obtaining higher scores in baseline tests such as coding, mathematics, science, reasoning and multimodules.

- Delays and costs are lower and are one of the most valuable models at present.

# # "**Who's the most cost-effective of the AI model**"
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/j7dkgvtyqrbuor6rf72elormfwrk)
- **The Gemini 2.5 series significantly increased the upper limit of value for money** and pushed Pareto as a whole to the top right corner.

- **Flash-Lite is currently one of the most cost-effective models**, especially for budget-sensitive applications that still require strong modelling capacity.

- ** “Thinking” + Long context + multi-model”** is fundamental to the leadership of the Google Gemini series.

♪ How do you look at this picture? ♪

- **Honger axis (up as high as possible): ** How smart and competent models are, for example, in terms of their ability to understand, write codes, watch videos, etc.

- ** Transverse (advanced by right): ** How much it costs to use this AI model at a time (cost of processing 1 million words).

** Top left**: Smart but expensive** Top right**: Smart and cheap!
The blue curve ** is:  a line linked to “the world's most cost-effective model” ** also known as “Pareto Frontier”.
Gemini 2.5 Pro

- Googles now ** the strongest AI brain**, smart as a watch.

- For example, you can read three hours of video, you can write web applications, you can read Harry Potter at once.

- Weaknesses: Precious! Suitable for scientific research and heavy development.

Gemini 2.5 Flash

- Smaller models,** smarter than GPT-4o, but cheaper**.

- Balanced: fast, cheap and reflective, suitable for chat robots, customer service, search and question systems.

Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (new release!)

- Super-high-priced "Quick Knife Little AI": especially low-cost, but still smart!

- For example, if you have thousands of customers who have to answer questions with AI at the same time, it's perfect.

- It is represented by the “top right corner” in the figure:** the cheaper the right, the smarter the higher and the better the better.**

# **Application case demonstration**:

- A research prototype: After the user uploads large PDF files, the Flash-Lite model can be converted into an interactive Web application in real time to facilitate understanding and synthesizing complex content.

- The example highlights the strong capacity of the model in dealing with complex structured information.


# ** How to use **:

- All 2.5 Flash and Pro models can be used on the following platforms:
Google AI Studio

- Google Cloud Vertex.

Fit for rapid deployment of AI tools and services by businesses and researchers.
