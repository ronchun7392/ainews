#Granola 2.0 Key Functions Detailed

#1 Sharing team folders: structured portals to conference knowledge

- Teams can create shared folders based on themes (e.g., “sale calls” “client feedback” “technical meetings” etc.)

- The contents in the folder support full-text search dialogue with AI and access and query without the member having an account number

- Retain references to all information and enhance transparency of information and the credibility of decision-making

Examples of scenarios: product managers can ask directly “What is the most recent user complaints function?” and the system automatically summarizes and identifies relevant session segments.

##2 Project collaboration folder: Agile response to important scenes

- Users can drag related meetings into a new folder and quickly generate a “collaborative space”

- Key business nodes applicable to financing preparation, release planning, customer follow-up, etc.

- Full consistency of content seen by everyone, saving time for redundant communication and replication of paste

#3 “Dialogue-type” knowledge analysis: an intelligent cross-chamber question-and-answer session

- Users can not only search keywords, but can also ask the entire folder in natural language**, like, "Ask a team assistant with a clear memory."

- The answer is linked to the context and can be transferred directly to the original dialogue position of the meeting

- Roles (e.g. products, sales, recruitment, etc.) that need to identify trends, summarize patterns from multiple meetings

##4 Multi-model support: reasoning is of higher quality and can switch autonomously

- Support for mainstream models (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

- Users can select models depending on the nature of the task, or they can authorize Granola to choose the best automatically

- Increased capacity for integration and reasoning of ** multi-session content** and improved accuracy of analysis of complex issues

##5 Enterprise-level directory browsing: Increased teamwork across teams

- Business users have access to all “public folders” in the company, such as sales databases, customer support questions databases, training records, etc.

- Helping to increase transparency of information and the efficiency of cross-sectoral collaboration

##6 Smart collation proposal: reduce the cost of manual cataloguing (coming online)

- The most appropriate folder for the system based on meeting titles, participants, historical behavior predictions

- User only needs one key confirmation to avoid missing “unarched” meetings

#7Slack Auto-promotion integration: seamless entry into workflow

- After each meeting, Granola will automatically post on the designated Slack channel:
Brief summary

- To-dos

- “Linkable dialogue session”

Even if members do not use Granola, they can keep abreast of the outcome of the meeting and engage in further collaboration

##8 Template start support: Quick-starter harmonized collaborative processes

- Provide predefined templates such as “user interview” “sale cycle” “interview process”

- Includes structure, permission configuration and AI dialogue tips, which can be used efficiently by the team on the first day
