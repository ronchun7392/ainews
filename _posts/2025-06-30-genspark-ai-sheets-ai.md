Genspark releases a completely new tool for “AI Sheets”** spreadsheets**, combining large language models and AI tools to allow users to process data like a dialogue.
The complete process of data search, collation, tabulation, analysis and visualization can be accomplished automatically through a simple natural language directive.
It not only automatically analyses and generates graphs, but also intelligently finds information and processes data, replacing complex formulae operating in traditional spreadsheets. Using AI, Genspark redefines the efficiency and accessibility of data processing to turn everyone into an efficient data analyst.

- ** Personal Data Analyst**: Automatic analysis and visualization of data based on user input.

- ** Automatic data collection**: Automatic search of companies, people, products, etc. without manual search or input.

- ** AI Alternative formula**: batch data processing using AI, image/video generator and AI proxy to break the traditional Excel limit.


# Five core competencies:

#1 Generate complete spreadsheets in natural languages
** A single command is required to create a table with complete data**. For example:
“I would like a list of the top 100 AI start-ups in Singapore, including profiles, revenue estimates, financing and networks.”

AI will search and generate a complete table of filled data without you moving a line code or a formula.

#2 Automatic data collection and organization
There is no need to copy paste from the various pages. The system is automated:

- On-line search for high-quality information

- Clear redundancies and align formats

- Keeping the data source to trace it is like "data reptiles + assistant + cleaning specialists" with a full-time job.

##3 Use AI instead of formula to automate
Genspark no longer relies on traditional functions such as =SUM() or =VLOOKUP(), but uses AI to automate more strongly:

- Bulk generation of personalized mail

- Batch Analysis YouTube Videos or Comments

- Text-to-language, large-scale image generation

- Cross-document extraction and cataloguing

AI Allows spreadsheets to become "** data automatic processing engines** " , which is not a simple computational tool.

# # 4 Everything turning table: document intelligence conversion
Support for import includes:

- PDF.

- Word Document

- Picture (OCR recognition form)

- Old Excel then converts the key to " Smart AI Tables " to continue analysis, question-and-answer, visualization.

##5 Smart analysis and visualization (separation complex function)
You can ask questions directly in language:

- “What is the growth trend in this data?”

- "Please compare the sales of these two brands."

AI will explain the results in graph + language, just like you're talking to a **data analyst**.

#  Example of practical application (click to view):

-  Automatic collection of data on American medical start-up companies
 
We're looking for a list of family SUVs under $40,000.

# Let's wrap it up and say:
** Genspark AI Sheets transformed the spreadsheet into a “talking autoanalyst” to help you break the manual search, copy paste and formulae to complete the entire data task from the beginning of a sentence.**
