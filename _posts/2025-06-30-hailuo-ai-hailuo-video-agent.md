Hailuo AI Launchs a test version of **Hailuo VideoAgent**, an AI video-generation tool that focuses on "zero operations " . Users can choose the Agent style and describe their ideas in natural languages, and the system automatically generates high-quality finished videos.
Without expertise and without relying on editing techniques, ordinary users can express themselves through AI by offering creative ideas. This ability to "invent" is expected to significantly reduce the cost of video content production.
Product development will be advanced in three phases: from templateization, semi-custody to the final full-automatic video production process.
The first phase is now online.

# ** Stage 3 evolutionary path**
The technical route of Hailuo Video Agent is clearly planned in three phases, gradually increasing customization and automation:
** Phase I: template-driven video generation (now open)**

- Provides preset Agent templates in which a user enters text or picture content in response to a reminder, which allows you to generate a short video by one key.

- This phase focuses on “i.e., use” creative experiences and is geared towards rapid access by non-professional users.

** Phase II: semi-custody video generation (scheduled for launch in summer)**

- Users can edit parts of the video on the basis of templates, including scripts, camera styles, sound formulations, etc., and enhance creative flexibility.

- For users with certain creative needs or aesthetic preferences.

** Phase III: fully automated video production process (under development)**

- The system can automatically generate complete video content based on the creative description entered by the user, with little need for artificial intervention.

- This is a full-process intelligent proxy vision for “from creativity to film”.

# ** Case presentation (Demo)**
