Microsoft presented a comprehensive strategic blueprint for its move towards the “AI proxy era” and the “Open Agency Web” at its conference in Build in 2025.
Microsoft claims that AI's agent, thanks to the breakthroughs in reasoning and memory, is becoming a central force for development, collaboration and scientific exploration. We envisage a world where intelligence can operate across individuals, organizations, teams, and end-to-end business environments. This emerging Internet vision** is an open network of smart people **, in which artificial intelligence is capable of making decisions and carrying out tasks on behalf of users or organizations.”
** Main highlights: **

- Release of enterprise-level AI proxy building platforms (multi-agent collaboration, customization, low code).

- Copilot supports business custom training (Copilot Tuning) and multi-agent programming.

- GitHub Copilot upgrades to asymptomatic code agent; Copilot Chat open source.

- Launch of the Windows AI Fundry and Azure AI Fundry Model Markets.

- Full support **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Establishment of agreed standards for the sharing of context among AI agents.

- Publication **NLWeb Project**: Make the website as HTML accessible to AI proxy semantic access and interaction.

#1 Reshaping software development process: AI is no longer just "accompanied" but "participant"

- **GitHub Copilot upgrades to "code agent"** are no longer just smart completions, but rather development partners with contextual memory, mission planning, and ante-step execution capabilities. For example, you can set targets in GitHub, which will help you analyse problems, generate codes, deploy, and do code reviews.

- The chat function of the **Copilot Chat open source integrated into VS Code**GitHub Copilot is now integrated into VS Code as an open source project with the participation of the developers' community in customization and expansion, reflecting Microsoft's commitment to “open development”.

- **Windows AI Foundation ** provides a unified platform to support local training, fine-tuning, deployment, and compatibility with open-source and private large models. Developers can easily run visual, language models without complex configurations.

##2 Build a powerful, controlled AI proxy ecology

- **Azure AI Foundry Agency online** Developer-oriented AI proxy platform to support collaboration between multiple agents (Multi-Agent), context sharing (Model Context Protocol) and semantic Kernel.

- **Observability tools: performance, cost and quality are clear**Azure provides a set of proxy monitoring tools to view agent performance, including response speed, reasoning quality, resource consumption, safety issues, etc., and to enhance enterprise control and compliance.

- **Entra Agency ID: Allocating a single identity to each AI agent** to avoid a proliferation of “agents” in enterprises and to ensure that the identity, rights and access to data of each AI system are strictly regulated.

#3 # let the company have its own "internal AI employee"

- **Copilot Tuning: Enterprise-defined AI proxy** enterprises can quickly train AI agents with internal data (e.g. documents, processes, regulations) without writing codes. For example, firms can build exclusive document-generation agents, styles and expressions can match organizational habits.

- ** Multi-agent organization: division of tasks, collaborative processing** Multiple agents can be organized into “tasks flow lines” in Copilot Studio, e.g., an analytical document, a generation aggregation, a sending mail to perform complex business processes together.

##4 # Push for Open Agency Web

- Full support **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, similar to the "AI communication protocol" allowing different platforms and models to share context. GitHub, Azure, Copilot Studio, etc.

- NLWeb project: Like HTML on the web page, NLWeb on the new open code published by AI interactive Microsoft, which allows web sites to expose interfaces in natural language plus in a structured way, and the AI model allows for a more accurate understanding of and interaction with web intent and promotes the development of the “semantic Internet”.

- GitHub and Microsoft joined the **MCP standard-setting committee** to promote industry standardization.

#5 AI + Scientific research: Microsoft Discory platform

- ** AI platform for scientific discovery** Microsoft Discory aims to embed “AI proxy” into scientific processes: from data exploration, hypothesis validation, simulation modelling, experimental design, to essay writing, outcome analysis, and process acceleration. It applies to a variety of fields, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, energy, materials, and promotes efficiency gains in basic research and industrial transformation.

# Open source GitHub Copilot Chat
Microsoft announced the opening of **GitHub Copilot Chat*** plugin** and the gradual integration of AI capabilities into the core of the **VS Code editor**. This marked the formal move of VS Code towards a new phase of “**Open Source AI programming environment**”.

# The background and motivation #
The Microsoft team summarized several key current changes in AI development and community feedback as a basis for decision-making to advance open sources:
** Large model capabilities evolved to reduce reliance on the "problem " **
In the past, in order to achieve better production effects, AI tools often need to use private hints to optimize strategies; but the larger model itself is now more generalized, making this “privatization fine-tuning” strategy no longer a core barrier.
2. ** User experience (UX) mode matured**
AI interactions in different editors (such as chat windows, automatic code completion styles, etc.) are increasingly standardized. Microsoft wants to promote open sharing of these functions through open-source approaches, encouraging communities to continue grinding.
3. **AI plugin ecological expansion**
The developers want to build their own AI plugins, but because the Copilot Chat plugins are closed-sourced, debugging and acceptance limits are higher. When open-sources, developers can learn more easily to achieve logic and achieve depth integration.
4. **Increased transparency in the use of data**
Community users are concerned about what VS Code AI plugins collect, and with open source plugins, all data-processing logic will become clear and help build confidence.
5. **Improving safety and using communities to detect loopholes**
History has shown that open sources help to detect and repair security gaps more quickly. This open mechanism is particularly important for AI editors.

# # Technology programmes and follow-up planning #
Copilot Chat plugin open source**

- The plugin code will use **MIT License** authorization;

- Core functions will be “dismantled and integrated” in the VS Code core module over time after open source;

- All contributors can participate in the optimization and re-engineering of the plugin.

** The Hint test frame will also be open**

- In order to address the “non-determinate question” of the results of the large model reasoning, Microsoft will open up the internal use of the **prompt test framework**;

- This will help the contributor verify whether the function is stable and the output is manageable when submitting Pull Request.

** Developer contribution path will be simplified**

- AI related functions will be as easy to contribute as other VS Code core functions;

- Future contribution prompt, UI logic, model access logic will all have uniform criteria.

Version management and progress tracking

- All developments will be updated on a monthly basis in the Development Plan at VS Code;

- The official FAQ page also provides simultaneous answers to frequently asked questions from the community.

# # The real value after the open source #
Meaning to the developer
The plugin development can learn the plugin source, reuse the generic components, better debugger the access custom model no longer relies on the official Copilot, can be replaced by other LLM security and data, identify which data will be collected and used, increase trust, contribute the threshold, lower learning curves, more complete testing infrastructure support
The meaning of the whole AI programming ecology.

- To provide a stable open-source infrastructure for standardized development;

- Encourage global developers to collaborate in the formation of diversified plugins and model-adaptation layers;

- Promote the new era of AI programming from "product trials" to "Developers' custom-based tool chains".

# New programming agent: Copilot Coding Agency
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/5wphr565bksrnigfvu2x7xhf3xik)同时微软发布了新的Copilot Coding Agent，一个**可被分配任务、自动提交代码、并集成 CI/CD 流程**的 AI 代理，具备自主编码、分析和迭代的能力。
It is no longer just an auxiliary writing code, but rather an “AI Agent” that can take the initiative** to perform development tasks**.

# Core competencies and workflows
1. ** Job-driven automatic development**

- Any GitHub Issue can be allocated to Copilot Agent (through Web, CLI, VS Code, GitHub App, etc.)

-Agent will automatically:
Activate Secure Virtual Environments (based on GitHub Actions)

- Cloning the code library, parsing the context (using enhanced retrieval + RAG technology)

- Write, push code to Drawr PR

- Update PR Description and Record Behavior Log

2. ** Capability to understand context**

- Analysis of mission intent using GitHub code search, file structure and historical discussion

- Support the extraction of pictures from PR/Issue for visual analysis (e. g. UI Mocup)

- Respond to the Human Developer's comments on Draft PR and continue over time

3. ** Multi-model call capability (MCP protocol support)**

- Through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Agent has access to non-GitHub data sources (e. g. intra-enterprise API or external document database)

- User can configure custom MPCP Server in project settings


# Security and access control mechanisms
In order to ensure the security of the team code library, Copilot Agent designed a set of strict protection strategies:

![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/n5y5zpp7mvdl75ewellapzxbz7wm)
# Use the scene and the applicable boundary
• Applicable task type:

- Low-moderate complexity, clear needs, clear borders
Bug repair, unit test completion, code re-engineering, document update, etc.

- Initial realization needs template, migration code structure, split logic module, etc.

Not applicable:

- Highly innovative, lacking clear context, and highly dependent on cross-domain tasks

- Needs requiring a great deal of subjective judgement and in-depth product understanding

# Integrating approach to environmental support

- Default operating environment: **GitHub Actions**

- Local Agent model support: VS Code, Xcode, Eclipse, Jet Brains, Visual Studio, etc.

- Enterprise users can set the activation policy uniformly and control which items will enable the Agent mode

# Use policy and billing instructions

- **To users**: Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ are available to users

- ** Since 4 June 2025**, each Agent request will be counted as one **Advanced Copilot request** for billing purposes

The difference between the traditional Copilot
