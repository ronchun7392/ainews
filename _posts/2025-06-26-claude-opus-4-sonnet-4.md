Anthropic published the Fourth Generation Series of the Claude Model: **Claude Opus 4** and **Claude Sonnet 4**, which is not only a systematic evolution of the original model but also of the future AI application landscape.
Whether it is code generation, complex reasoning, long-term task processing or intelligent proxy construction, they show significant advantages.

- **Contextual Intelligence**: no longer simple command execution, but understanding why and how. Your 100th mission with Agent should be much better than the 1st, like the 100th day of the new employee; Claude 4 shows the greatness of this ability. In the tests, it will proactively create a "rememory file" to save key information. When playing with Pokemon, it will even write navigation notes: "Try five times and stay stuck; if stuck, try the opposite direction; go to the other side of the room when the indoor navigation takes place." This autonomous learning and knowledge accumulation is the core value of the human workforce.

- **Long-runing Exchange**: Addressing complex tasks that take hours or even days to coordinate other Agents and humans. This is not only a matter of durability, but also the ability to maintain unity of purpose and consistency in context;

- ** Genuine Collaboration: ** Transparent reasoning process, adapted to human style of work. The key is the balance between "intelligent autonomy" and "human oversight" -- AI deals with cumbersome details, humans take control of the big directions.

** The memory capacity has improved considerably**:

- ‚ÄúLong-term memory‚Äù can be created by accessing local documents, extracting and retaining key facts

Example: Opus 4 automatically writes notes to record the strategy when playing a treasured dream, and these are real notes generated by the model itself.

- Models can create ‚Äúrememory files‚Äù for the storage of mission-critical data.

- Be of particular excellence in the application of AI proxy assignments, allowing for contextual consistency in successive sessions.

** Mandate simplification and controlled thinking presentation**

- Introduction of a "thinking digestor" to refine the reasoning chain over a long period of time, using only about 5% of the cases.

- Developers can apply for "Developer Mode" to see the full reasoning trail for advanced prompt debugging.

# Performance comparison versus actual validation
** Benchmarking lead**

- Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are at the top of the SWE-Bench Verified.

- Opus 4 performed excellently in a number of long, multi-round reasoning benchmarks, significantly exceeding Claude 3.7.
