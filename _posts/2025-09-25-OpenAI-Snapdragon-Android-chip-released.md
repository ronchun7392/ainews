Snapdragon Android chip released! Fully pave the way for agents


Terminal chips such as mobile phones and PCs will also be reshaped in the face of the Agent revolution.

Just now, Qualcomm released the world's fastest Windows PC processor and the world's fastest mobile SoC processor:

+Snapdragon X2 Elite Series
    
+The fifth generation Snapdragon 8 Ultimate Edition mobile platform
    

For PC, Qualcomm has launched the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme for the first time, specifically designed for ultra high end PCs, with the goal of "easily mastering the AI experience of intelligent agents";

Targeting mobile phones, the Snapdragon 8 series mobile platform will be able to support a "truly personalized intelligent AI assistant" that can deeply understand users through continuous terminal side learning, real-time perception, multimodal AI models, and provide customized operations across applications.

Qualcomm CEO Anmeng also simultaneously proposed six understandings of AI trends, which not only correspond to the latest release, but also secretly revealed how Qualcomm will subvert personal computing systems with intelligent agents as the core:

+AI is the new UI
    
+Shift from smartphone centric to agent centric
    
+Need to build a new computing architecture system
    
+Model mixing development
    
+Edge data correlation enhancement
    
+6G will become a bridge connecting cloud edge devices

This kind of thinking and understanding has been glimpsed in the latest release.

##One release, two of the fastest in the world

###Fastest PC: Snapdragon X2 Elite Series

The Snapdragon X2 Elite series adopts a 3nm process and the third-generation Oryon architecture (12 Prime cores+6 Performance cores).

Various peak performance has been comprehensively improved compared to the previous generation:

+Single core CPU peak performance improved by 39%
    
+50% increase in peak performance of multi-core CPU
    
+GPU peak performance increased by 2.3 times
    
+NPU peak performance improved by 78%

Compared to the previous generation, there has been a 31% increase in CPU energy efficiency and power consumption, with a significant 43% reduction in power consumption.

The maximum multi-core frequency of the Prime core is 4.4GHz, with a maximum of 5.0GHz for a single core and 5.0GHz for a dual core. The highest frequency of the Performance core can reach 3.6GHz.

According to Gao, this breaks the clock frequency record of ARM architecture CPUs.

In this series, the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is designed specifically for ultra high end PCs, making it easy to handle tasks such as intelligent AI experience, complex data analysis, and scientific research.

At the same power consumption, Qualcomm stated that the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme achieved a 75% performance improvement compared to other products.

Other similar products need to consume an additional 222% to achieve such performance.

Here, the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is mainly compared with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX-370 and Intel Core Ultra 9 288V/285H.

In terms of GPU, Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is 52% faster than its competitors under the same power consumption; Competitors need to spend 92% more energy to achieve the same performance.

Qualcomm stated that laptops equipped with Snapdragon X2 Elite series will be launched in the first quarter of 2026.

###Fastest mobile phone: 5th generation Snapdragon 8 Ultimate Edition

The fifth generation Snapdragon 8 Ultimate Edition adopts a 3nm process.

The CPU uses the third-generation Oryon architecture; 2 Prime cores+6 Performance cores.

The maximum frequency of the large P core is 4.6GHz, and the maximum performance of the small P core is 3.62GHz. Single core performance improved by 20%, multi-core performance improved by 17%, response speed increased by 32%, making it the fastest mobile CPU in the world.

The GPU adopts the upgraded Adreno GPU, with a maximum clock speed of 1.2GHz, a 23% improvement in gaming performance, and a 25% improvement in ray tracing performance.

Adreno's independent high-speed video memory has 18MB of dedicated memory, with an energy efficiency improvement of up to 10% and a performance improvement of up to 38%.

The NPU kernel includes 12 scalars, 8 vectors, and 1 tensor kernel, with an overall performance improvement of 37%, and can process 220 tokens per second. Supports INT2 and FP8 precision, and supports 32K 2-bit context windows.

In addition, it also pioneered continuous learning of terminal AI.

The overall power consumption has decreased, with CPU decreasing by 35%, GPU decreasing by 20%, and overall decreasing by 16%.

In terms of camera, the upgraded ISP supports APU (Advanced Professional Video) codec. And the computer video pipeline will be enabled. This will allow for frame by frame AI enhancement of videos, and ISP also supports context aware autofocus, auto exposure, and auto white balance.

Integrated X85 5G Modem RF system for communication, supporting AI enhanced WiFi and reducing game latency by 50%.

And the mobile phone platform equipped with this chip should also be able to meet everyone soon.

Because Xiaomi 17 will be released tonight. The competition for the first release is fierce now, and if Qualcomm Snapdragon doesn't work hard, it won't be able to catch up with Xiaomi's release speed (doge).
