After being sued for espionage by Musk xAI for a week, OpenAI's response finally came.

OpenAI has revealed that it has submitted a defense and motion to dismiss this incident to the court. It not only denies the allegations but also accuses Musk of abusing his litigation rights to harass him.

And OpenAI's announcement is very firm in its stance, stating that it will protect its employees and will not be intimidated by "bullying behavior".

XAI accuses OpenAI of stealing secrets from xAI through premeditated and systematic poaching in the face of technological competition pressure from Grok.

The indictment lists the departing employees of xAI involved and identifies one of OpenAI's HR personnel as the mastermind behind this series of poaching and "espionage" activities.

OpenAI countered that it had no intention of stealing any company's trade secrets, and that the purpose of xAI's lawsuit was to intimidate employees, not to protect trade secrets as it claimed.

At the same time, it was also pointed out that the frequent employee resignations at xAI were purely due to internal or Musk related issues.

It can be seen that OpenAI, with a valuation of $500 billion, has responded quite strongly.

##XAI raises three charges

From a legal perspective, xAI has three charges against OpenAI, namely violating federal trade secret protection laws, intentionally interfering with xAI's economic expectations with employees, and violating California's unfair competition laws.

As the basis for the accusation, there are also three specific events listed by xAI.

Firstly, Xuechen Li, an early engineer at xAI responsible for the core work of GroK model development, was involved in the espionage incident.

XAI stated that Li presented a presentation document containing xAI secrets during an interview with OpenAI.

After receiving the OpenAI offer, OpenAI recruiter Tifa Chen sent him a "cloud drive link" through Signal, and then Li uploaded the "entire xAI code repository" to his private cloud drive and transferred it to his laptop. Three days later, Li resigned from xAI.

XAI also stated that Li searched for web pages such as "How to recover deleted files" in an attempt to cover up the traces, and believed that OpenAI was at least "aware" of it, and even "encouraged" or "induced" Li to engage in the aforementioned behavior.

Previously, xAI had filed a lawsuit against Xuechen Li personally, and Li had admitted to the leakage of information in both oral and written forms under the witness of a lawyer. However, just after Li admitted to stealing the information, xAI discovered other stolen materials that he had not yet disclosed.

Another core engineer, Jimmy Fraiture, also participated in the development of the Grok model and was accused of synchronizing the source code to personal devices before joining OpenAI.

When he was in the "garden leave" stage (a paid transition period before formally joining the new company during the resignation notice period), he began to delete and clean up these files.

XAI believes that Fraiture's actions and the technology used (AirDrop, locally encrypted files, deleted logs) indicate its intention to deliberately cover up traces.

XAI believes that his behavior is closely related to OpenAI recruitment, and his employment position overlaps with the original responsibilities of xAI. The recruitment officer contacted by OpenAI is also Tifa Chen.

In addition to the technical personnel, there is also an undisclosed former Senior Finance Executive of xAI who is accused of changing jobs to OpenAI without signing a confidentiality agreement.

XAI stated that the supervisor has knowledge of xAI's ability and strategy to rapidly deploy AI data centers, and this information is considered a 'core trade secret'.

When he resigned, he refused to sign the confidentiality commitment letter, which required the employee to confirm that all confidential information had been deleted, no copies had been retained, and no documents had been taken away. xAI claimed that this refusal meant that he "intentionally carried and used xAI information".

The xAI legal team contacted the employee after leaving and requested an explanation, but the employee only replied with some vulgar language, which led xAI to infer that their attitude was bad and their subjective malice was clear.

At the same time, the employee has no background in data centers or AI industry, and after joining OpenAI, they held a position related to data center expenditure strategy, which proves that OpenAI is a "precise headhunter" with the aim of obtaining strategic information.

In addition to these employees, xAI also mentioned and named several former xAI employees who were systematically poached by OpenAI, and all of these people have access to key business information, but they have not been accused of any breach of confidentiality.

In summary, xAI believes that OpenAI, led by Tifa Chen, is suspected of premeditated poaching and inciting former employees to steal core secrets, and a series of actions have "systematic" and "malicious" nature, disrupting the fair competition order.

##OpenAI: This is bullying behavior

OpenAI, on the other hand, refuted the accusation of "theft" against the personnel listed by xAI one by one.

Firstly, Xuechen Li, OpenAI * * directly denied the existence of the three companies - no employment, no data transmission, and no so-called presentation * *.

Specifically, although Li accepted the offer, he did not actually start working, and the link sent by HR to Li at that time was only the onboarding document package, which Li could only download but not upload.

As for the part of "attempting to cover up traces", OpenAI stated that even if the allegations are true, they have nothing to do with itself and that it knows nothing about this matter.

Another technician, Jimmy Fraitus, did join OpenAI, but did not hand over any xAI secrets to OpenAI.

OpenAI stated that Fraitus' act of deleting files during the garden leave phase was purely a personal action, and OpenAI was not aware of it. They did not request that Fraitus hand over any secrets, and their position at OpenAI did not have any specific direction.

Regarding the unnamed financial director, OpenAI also revealed even more explosive news - he only contacted OpenAI a few weeks after leaving and had nothing to do with poaching. The reason for his resignation was because he refused xAI's "improper financial operations".

The confidentiality agreement that the supervisor refused to sign is not a mandatory obligation, and venting his fragrance to the legal team is also an emotional expression. In short, it has nothing to do with espionage.

Overall, OpenAI has not obtained, accessed, or used any confidential information from xAI, and all recruitment activities are legal and compliant.

Having experience in the AI industry is also a reasonable criterion for recruitment, and the founder of xAI also has a work background in companies such as OpenAI/DeepMind/Microsoft/Google.

And OpenAI * * explicitly informs new employees not to carry former employer secrets * * and signs corresponding commitments.

What most displeases OpenAI is that xAI's former employees who have not been accused of leaking secrets have also been publicly named by xAI. OpenAI believes that this is malicious "human flesh" aimed at intimidating current or potential job hopping employees.

OpenAI has filed a motion requesting the court to dismiss xAI's lawsuit, or at least delete these paragraphs that contain information about departing employees but are unrelated to "espionage".

The hearing on this motion will be held on November 18th this year, but it is a procedural hearing and not a substantive trial or adjudication of the case.

As for how the conflict between the two sides will ultimately end, or
