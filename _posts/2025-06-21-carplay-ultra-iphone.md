Apple officially released its new-generation vehicle system: **CarPlay Ultra**,** which for the first time integrated iPhone with all the screen depths of the vehicle** and was not limited to the central screen but cut across the cockpit.
The system** has been officially launched today in the new Aston Martin model in the North American region,** and plans are under way to support more models through software upgrades. The next 12 months will further expand to global and other car companies.

# Core functions and characteristics
CarPlay Ultra provides the following key features through deep integration of vehicle systems and iPhone functionality:
** Full-screen integration**

- ** Covers all driver screens**: CarPlay Ultra extends content to every vehicle screen, including central touch screens and digital dashboards, providing uniform design language. The dashboard displays dynamic, fine speed scales, speed gauges, oil gauges, temperature meters, etc.

- **Info **: Support the simultaneous display of iPhone applications (e.g. Apple Maps, Apple Music) and vehicle data (e.g. advanced driving aids, fetal pressure) to ensure that drivers are aware.

- ** Full-screen navigation**: Apple Maps can be shown on the dashboard full-screen and provide visual navigational experience.

** Functional control of vehicles**

- **Natural control**: The user does not need to exit the CarPlay Ultra interface to control vehicle functionality, including:
**Climate App**: Adjusted temperature, wind, etc., done directly in CarPlay.

- **Radio App**: Toggle AM/FM, SiriusXM radio or adjust sound balancers.

- ** Performance settings**: manage vehicle-specific functions, such as driving patterns or sound configurations.

** Multi-input method**: Support screen touch control, physical buttons and Siri voice control, Siri can handle simple tasks (e.g. adjust temperature) and answer complex questions (but cannot directly access the vehicle manual) through Apple Intelligence integration ChatGPT.

- ** User personalization**: Drivers can customise dashboard colours, wallpapers and layouts (although layout options are fixed and may be expanded in the future through OTA updates).

**Widgets**

- Introduction of small components in iPhone style, suitable for inside screens, displaying information on calendar events, weather, fetal pressure, etc.

- A small widget page can be customised to provide a quick overview of information through a right-hand slide from the home page.

** The seamless connection**

- **Autostart**: After the first wireless or cable connection, CarPlay Ultra automatically starts as default UI when entering the vehicle.

- **Quick pair**: Once connected, screen displays a joint welcome interface between Apple and auto brands (e.g. Aston Martin), similar to the new iPhone registration experience.

** Privacy and data**

- Apple emphasizes that CarPlay Ultra uses the same privacy measures as iPhone to minimize data shared with vehicles (e.g. song information or call data).

- Partial functionality (e.g., back-up cameras) is still handled by the primary system and can be “penetrated” by the CarPlay interface.
