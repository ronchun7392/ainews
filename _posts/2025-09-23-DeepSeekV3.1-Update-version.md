#DeepSeek V3.1 Update 'Final Version'! Is it V4/R2 next time???

The bug of 'extremely beautiful' has indeed been fixed in the latest version of DeepSeek V3.1.

DeepSeeker V3.1 has just been updated to the DeepSeeker V3.1 Terminus version.

The new version mainly improves on the previous user feedback issues while maintaining the original model capabilities, such as the model inexplicably randomly spitting out the word "extreme".

Compared to Tristan, this version name includes "Terminus" - the end point.

Wow, does that mean the next update will be V4 or R2???

##The final version V3.1?

The official announcement describes the improvements made to the Terminus version as follows:

+Consistency in language proficiency: alleviates situations such as mixing Chinese and English, occasional abnormal characters, etc;
    
+Agent capability: Further optimized the performance of Code Agent and Search Agent.
    

One is the bug that caused a lot of discussion around the world before, and the official promised to fix it early on.

One that seems to confirm the rumor once again - DeepSeek's next move is to target intelligent agents and develop new models with stronger AI agent capabilities.

With the new version in hand, DeepSeek also conducted a new round of evaluations, and the performance of the new model is as follows:

As can be seen, the Terminus version has a more stable overall output compared to the previous version.

However, some netizens have raised questions: for example, in the Codeforces programming competition, DeepSeeker V3.1 Terminus' score has actually dropped significantly. Is it because security adjustments have affected the model's "inspiration"?

What more netizens are paying attention to is the version name * * Terminus * *:

>Does Terminus imply that this is the last version of the V3 series?

Some people have already started to imagine that the next version will be a completely new architecture (V4). After all, the naming of DeepSeek is quite regular, unlike a factory in Silicon Valley

But as friends who have written papers know

So if there is any Deepseek-V3.1-Terminus-Final-V2-Last... it is reasonable, reasonable (manual dog head).

Earlier, DeepSeek was revealed to be expected to release a new model by the end of this year.

What do you think we will see in the next three months?
