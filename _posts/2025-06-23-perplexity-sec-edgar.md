Perplexity announced the introduction of a completely new feature:** The EDGAR database**, which connects the United States Securities Commission (SEC), converts tens of thousands of raw data from listed companies, such as financial reporting, strategic plans, significant risk disclosure, into dialogueable, searchable and verifiable real-time answers through AI semantic understanding and natural language processing capabilities.
This feature has been integrated into the Perplexity:

** Smart search engine**

-  Research assistant**

-  Laboratories platform **Labs**

By asking questions, users can:

- Query for company updates (e.g.: “Texla Q1 Performance Summary”)

- Knowledge of industry peer comparison

- Access to information on the outlook of professional analysts

All responses** were accompanied by precise source references**, which allowed a key to be leaped to the original document for validation and ensured that ** transparency was retroactive**.
All Perplexity users have access to SEC data through PercySearch, Research and Labs.

- Too often there's a lack of context.

- Key information is hidden (e.g. risk factors, management outlook)

- It's difficult to conduct further in-depth studies.

In contrast, the SEC integration of Perplexity has the following advantages:

- ** Students and researchers**: access to first-hand data and more solid reporting

- ** Entrepreneur or industry analyst**: Insighting the financial and strategic dynamics of competitors

- **Professionals such as lawyers, bankers and others**: Rapid access to relevant documentation in the context of transactional and transactional reconciliation

#  Enterprise-level enhancements: further data integration

- **FactSet** (M&As, minutes of meetings, etc.)

- **Crunchbase** (Collaborative structure and investment information)

- ** Own corporate database** (uploading files for semantic retrieval)
