Higgsfield AI launched its most significant product update to date: **Higsfield Speak**, an AI tool that quickly converts text scripts into "action-driven oral video." By selecting a video style and virtual image, and entering the content to be said, the system automatically generates a complete video of mouth synchronisation, body language and emotional performance.
The tool provides creators with 16 common types of video scenes covering various uses such as vlogs, podcasts, make-up, education, sales, etc. that can significantly simplify content production processes.
At the same time, it supported the uploading of custom images, which greatly expanded the use of the scene.
** very suitable for:** - User-generated advertising content library - scenario comedy and programme format - teaching and coaching content - faceless YouTube channel - net red cloning - short video broadcast at the mouth of the bomb
Higgsfield Speak is currently open to Pro and Ultimate users.
