Captions release Mirage Studio, which quickly generates virtual role videos with real emotions and moves.

# The technology core

- Self-researched ** global model based on Captions (omni-modal foundation model)**

- Content generation is understood and combined with various forms of input, such as audio, text, images, etc.

# What can it do?

- **Auto-generated video**: Generates a role video with real performance based on audio, scene description or reference images uploaded by the user

- ** Virtual actor performances are real**: roles can perform, such as:
Smile, blink, make a face.

- Singing, rapping.

- Expression of emotions, interactive dialogue, etc.

**Coherence of roles**: A custom character allows for a consistent look and style in multiple lenses and scenes

# Detailed function #
** Create virtual actor**

- Users can define their own virtual roles, without the need for real people to be present, and without the need for actors to film them. It is appropriate for brands to create a particular style or role image.
 
** Turn the picture into an actor**

- With a photo of a person, the system can generate a virtual actor with the appearance and can be used to execute actions and conversations in the video.

** Expression of tender emotion**

- Virtual actors support highly recalibrated facial expressions, such as frowns, smiles, surprises and so on, to enhance emotional authenticity and to increase the resonance of viewers.

♪ To make the skin feel real ♪

- The roles generated by Mirage Studio are of high quality skin texture, photogramming and detail, far beyond the traditional “false human perception” CG roles.

** Generate 30 seconds of full video**

- Rapid generation of complete video clips suitable for advertising, short plays, social media content, without the need for late editing teams.
