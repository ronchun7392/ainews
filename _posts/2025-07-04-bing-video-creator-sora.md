# # prompting advice:
Example for high quality Prompt:
In a busy Italian pizza rehabilitation, a small hour works as a chef and wears a chef's hat and an aron, he kneads the doughs with his paws and is surrounded by another pizza effect.
“In a busy Italian pizza restaurant, a little otter, wearing a chef's hat and apron, is rubbing his face with claws and stuffed with food.”
Techniques for upgrading the quality of production:

- ** Use specific action **: e. g. dancing, flinging, painting, etc.

- ** Set scene**: e.g. "in a rainy Tokyo street at night"

- ** Styled hint**: e. g. "in the style of a Pixar animation" or "like a dramatic movie trainer"

**1. Describe your hint in a descriptive way: “** The more vivid and concrete your hint is, the better it will be. Rather than “a person walking”, it will be “a young woman in a red coat walks through a snow forest at sunrise.” The more details, the better. Adding the angle and the light will also help the model to convey what you want.

**2. Use of action-oriented and scenario-set language:** verbs such as “dancing”, “exploring” or “deformation” help AI to understand movements and intentions, thus producing more moving visual effects. Adjectives such as “film senses”, “sunshine” or “dreaming” contribute to the overall culture of the video.
 
**3. Try different styles and styles: ** Wants a movie sense? Adds a movie preview style. Wants to be interesting? Try a cartoon animation. A hint can significantly change aesthetics.
