And not only in the US region, but also in India, Canada, Morocco and other places, Gemini has achieved the summit.
And everything is thanks to: * * Nano Banana is so user-friendly * * (and free).
Just as the previous "Studio Ghibli gameplay" has driven the growth of ChatGPT users, Google's image generation tool Nano Banana, launched in August, is currently considered by the outside world to be the most critical factor driving Gemini's explosion.
In less than a month, the Gemini application added 23 million new users during this period, and Nano Banana was also used to edit over 500 million images.

**Gameplay 3: Play with a model. **
Is the gameplay of Nano Banana figurines commonplace? Don't panic, there are still a bunch of enhanced versions here, and we need to catch up with the latest trends.
Let's first take a look at the original desktop version:
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/13.jpeg)
Prompt：Create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a computer desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is a 3D modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a toy packaging box, designed in a style reminiscent of high-quality collectible figures, printed with original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.
Next, let's increase the difficulty and come up with a Drifting Bottle Plus version.

Prompt：Create a giant hyper-realistic statue based on the given photo, keeping the original face exactly the same without changes. The statue stands tall in the middle of a roundabout in Dhaka, near a famous historical landmark. The statue is still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding, with many construction workers in yellow helmets and orange vests climbing, welding, and working on it. Parts of the statue’s body are still exposed metal framework, while other sections are already detailed and finished. The background shows the realistic atmosphere of VARANASI CITY: crowded streets with colorful rickshaws, packed buses, and small cars circling the roundabout. Street vendors with tea stalls, fruit carts,  and colorful umbrellas line the roadside. Shop signs, big billboards, and messy hanging electric wires crisscross above the streets, creating the typical Dhaka city vibe. The bright daytime sky shines above, with tropical trees and a bustling, lively atmosphere. Style: photorealistic, vibrant, and full of life.
**Gameplay 4: Compare and modify local elements. **
For example, when trying on new clothes, the advanced combination function of Nano Banana is used, which can combine elements from different images together. The new clothes can be instantly put on, and Ma Ma no longer has to worry about me buying clothes randomly

Prompt：Create a new image by combining the elements from the provided images. Take the \[element from image 1\] and place it with/on the \[element from image 2\]. The final image should be a \[description of the final scene\].
If you have decoration dilemma, you can also ask Nano Banana to help preserve the overall style and only replace one furniture element.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/19.jpeg)
Prompt：Using the provided image, change only the \[specific element\] to \[new element/description\]. Keep everything else in the image exactly the same, preserving the original style, lighting, and composition.
**Gameplay 5: Welcome to the virtual world. **
Creating various virtual scenes is no problem, such as a fighting game between two monsters.

The contrast between the textured white paper and the detailed landscape creates a striking visual effect, capturing a feeling of discovery and wonder.
Cough cough, finally let's talk about the six categories of prompts added by Kangkang Google official (serious version).
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/22.jpeg)
**Gameplay 6: Play with real photography. **
Nano Banana is the AI camera you hold up in your hand. Simply add camera angle, lens type, lighting, and polish billions of details in the prompt words, and a super realistic AI photo will be born immediately.
Be like this portrait below, the wrinkles and contours on the face are clearly visible.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/23.jpeg)
Prompt：A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay. Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful. Vertical portrait orientation.
**Gameplay 7: Create stylized stickers. **
To have Nano Banana assist with the design, it is necessary to clarify all details, that is, to become a qualified client * (bushi) *, including sticker style, key features, and color selection, etc.
Well, I feel like the sticker for the red panda below can directly produce materials. Pinch it
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/24.jpeg)
Prompt：A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It’s munching on a green bamboo leaf. The design features bold, clean outlines, simple cel-shading, and a vibrant color palette. The background must be white.
**Gameplay 8: Create a brand logo. **
According to official sources, Gemini is quite good at rendering text, so it is perfect for logo design. Of course, it is also necessary to clearly describe the text and font that you want to embed.
For example, the clever design of the coffee beans in the coffee shop logo below was not created by Nano Banana herself, and it still relies on the intelligent little brain of humans to give instructions.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/25.jpeg)
Prompt：Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called ‘The Daily Grind’. The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. The design should feature a simple, stylized icon of a coffee bean seamlessly integrated with the text. The color scheme is black and white.
**Gameplay 9: Take professional product photos. **
Product shooting is different from regular real shooting. As a brand promotion photo, Nano Banana needs to selectively highlight product features, and the scene must also serve the product. In addition to selecting camera parameters, the details of the product should also be fully expressed in the prompt words.
For example, in this product photo generated by the official, a specific material description was added to the prompt: a minimalist matte black ceramic coffee cup on a polished concrete surface.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/26.jpeg)
Prompt：A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a minimalist ceramic coffee mug in matte black, presented on a polished concrete surface. The lighting is a three-point softbox setup designed to create soft, diffused highlights and eliminate harsh shadows. The camera angle is a slightly elevated 45-degree shot to showcase its clean lines. Ultra-realistic, with sharp focus on the steam rising from the coffee. Square image.
**Gameplay 10: Minimalist background design. **
For websites, PPTs, etc., the background requirements are generally minimalist and clean, so when generating with Nano Banana, it can be suggested that a large open canvas is needed.
For example, when generating the PPT background template, leaving a large area of blank space also preserves enough embedding space for users to fill in text themselves in the future.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/27.jpeg)
Prompt：A minimalist composition featuring a single, delicate red maple leaf positioned in the bottom-right of the frame. The background is a vast, empty off-white canvas, creating significant negative space for text. Soft, diffused lighting from the top left. Square image.
**Gameplay 11: Become a cartoonist. **
Nano Banana allows anyone to become a manga artist, and all you need to do is tell your story, the screenwriter is you, and the artist is it.
For example, on a rainy night, a mysterious detective suddenly appeared in the small town
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/28.jpeg)
Prompt：A single comic book panel in a gritty, noir art style with high-contrast black and white inks. In the foreground, a detective in a trench coat stands under a flickering streetlamp, rain soaking his shoulders. In the background, the neon sign of a desolate bar reflects in a puddle. A caption box at the top reads “The city was a tough place to keep secrets.” The lighting is harsh, creating a dramatic, somber mood. Landscape.
##Google finally welcomes the 'App Store moment'
To be honest, since being suppressed by ChatGPT, Google has truly made a comeback with Nano Banana.
The feud between the two families can be traced back almost to the founding of OpenAI
Elon Musk (one of the earliest founders of OpenAI) revealed in a public interview last year that he actually founded OpenAI to some extent to counter Google:
>This is largely a unipolar world, with Google completely dominating the AI field.
That is to say, the confrontation between the two families is inherent in their genes. Later on, OpenAI indeed captured all the attention with ChatGPT, leaving almost all players, including Google, under the shadow of ChatGPT.
For a long time, Google was almost always in a catching up position, and there were various "rollovers" in the process.
For example, when ChatGPT quickly became a national application, Google's hasty launch of Bard was once roast that its experience was far inferior to ChatGPT.
Even AI summaries, AI generated images, and other tools launched have sparked widespread controversy due to issues such as content errors and infringement of privacy portraits.
However, with Google continuously launching new Gemini series, the situation has finally begun to reverse.
On the one hand, Google is gradually filling its gaps in technology. Gemini 1.5 directly extends the context length to the million level, Gemini 2.0 has been praised by the outside world as "fully benchmarking and even partially surpassing GPT-4", and Gemini 2.5 Pro has received a lot of praise in terms of code, reasoning and other abilities.
On the other hand, perhaps more importantly, Google played the ecological card. Gemini is no longer an isolated model, but is embedded in core applications such as search, Chrome browser, YouTube, Gmail, Docs, covering billions of users worldwide.
The result is that from being forced to take extra classes at one point to now surpassing ChatGPT in the App Store rankings, Google has ushered in a true "comeback moment".
The majority of netizens' reactions are like:
>Well deserved, continue to maintain.
![图片](/style/image/2025-09-16/29.jpeg)
In fact, every time an AI application reaches the top of the App Store, it can be seen as a new peak in the industry.
Whether it's ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Gemini this time, they are all marked with "App Store moments" behind them - it's not just about winning rankings, but also a concentrated reflection of a company's AI product influence, user acceptance, and market landscape changes.
Therefore, we can also understand why Musk previously accused Apple of controlling app rankings.
Just last month, Musk filed a formal antitrust lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple, accusing Apple of manipulating app rankings in the Apple Store, favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT, and suppressing Musk's own Grok.
At that time, netizens found that not only were ChatGPT ads overwhelming when opening the Apple Store, but ChatGPT was also among the top on multiple charts, while the presence of other generative AI applications was rare.
But now, the peak of Google Gemini has been ridiculed by netizens as:
One of the evidences that can be used to break Apple's manipulation of the app market is the manual dog head.
