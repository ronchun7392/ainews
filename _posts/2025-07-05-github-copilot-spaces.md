GitHub introduces a new feature **Copilot Spaches**, which enhances Copilot's ability to understand the project context. This feature allows developers** to centrally manage the project context**, thus allowing GitHub Copilot to provide more **relevant and intelligent code advice and support**.
Engineering teams often face a fundamental problem: ** Knowledge fragmentation**. Information such as codes, documents, design descriptions, development decisions etc. is spread across multiple locations (or within the brain of team members) to make it difficult for developers to move quickly to a project or to collaborate efficiently.
**Copilot Spaches is designed to solve this problem. It provides more precise, relevant advice and support by ** constructing the context centre (context hub)** to give GitHub Copilot a deeper and systematic understanding of the project.

# Core function

# 1. ** Context perception: let Copilot understand "What are you doing"?**
Copilot Spaces allows you to combine the following elements in a "Space":

- Source code (directly binding GitHub repository)

- Project documents, instructions, design specifications (specs)

- Remarks, guidance or FAQ

- Custom Commands

![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/2pbmx4i7bw384a4i9utmo5v44o28)这样，Copilot 不再“孤立地猜测”，而是像一个对项目了如指掌的内部开发者，能回答：

- What does this module do?

- Why do you use this structure?

- Is there an example code?

- Is some kind of best practice followed?

##2. **Organization sharing: team-level knowledge reuse accelerator**
You can create one or more Copilot Spaces for the whole organization:

- Immediately upon joining, colleagues are given a unified context and no longer “be aware of the code library from scratch”

- Support rapid onboarding, knowledge inheritance, cross-sectoral collaboration

- More structured than a document library, more intelligent than README

This leaves Copilot not just as a personal assistant, but as a team's “situation AI collaborators”.

##3. **Automated synchronization: no manual maintenance of code copy**
You don't need to copy paste files, you just need to ** bind the warehouse**, Copilot Space can automatically:

- Get the latest version of the code and document

- Autosync with project updates (real time to reflect changes)

- Keep an accurate understanding of the current state

This ensures that Copilot always responds to questions on the basis of “up-to-date, real” projects.
