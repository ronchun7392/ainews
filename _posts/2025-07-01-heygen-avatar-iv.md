HeyGen publishes its state-of-the-art AI model Avatar IV. A user can generate a personalized video by providing a photograph, a script and his own voice.

- The new model is based on a "dispersive audio-driven emoticon engine" capable of synthesizing real facial expressions and movements according to the rhythm of speech, tone, emotion.

- Support side-face images and angles change to produce more film-sensitive images.

- Support for portraits, semi-body and body formats, adapted to different scenarios

- Not only are voices synchronized, but they can also “understand” semantics and emotions, displaying micro-actions such as pauses, nods, tone swings, etc.

- A variety of scenes can be used for virtual person videos, AI face-to-face content creation, manipulator effects, pet image drawing, play-playing and podcast visualization.


# Core technology: audio-driven emoticon generation engine**

- **Diffusion-inspired Audio-to-Expression Engineering** is no longer the traditional "synchronous voice-to-mouth" but analyses sound from deep neural networks:
**Tone**

- **Rhythm**

- ** Emotion**

- **Intent**

And then driving facial expressions, head micro-motions and "Temporal Realism":

- Noding, pauses, eyebrows, changes in the mouth, and so on.

- Showing a sense of speaking, not a simple reading.


# #  ** The process is extremely simple**
A self-photo, a text script, uploading your own voice.
A video that is "as if I were talking to you" can be synthesized.

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # you know, you know, you know, # # # you know, you know, you know, you know, #
♪ The real feeling is strong ♪

- Faces flow naturally, not hard, not mechanical.

- To achieve the "Video Simulation of Humans" quality

** Support multi-angle photos**

- It's not just the face, it's the side, it's the two-thirds angle.

- Make the results more filmic.

**According to AI to generate images**

- Support the movement of the human face created by Stable Diffusion or other tools

- Voice-driven emoticons, consistent tone, synchronized rhythm.

** Increased creativity and personal expression**

- Can make virtual characters ** sing ** (sync)

- ** Easy to create UGC ** Use only self-photographs and sound to make influential videos - no need to film.

- Can give ** pet image** or ** illustration role** expression

- Can give **immotive or pixel characters** the ability to broadcast orally.

- ** Dynamic comics and animations can be: ** Translating static animations or illustrations of cartoon style into dynamic, expressive videos - including emotions.

- **Vision podcast content: ** To upgrade your audio content with every nuanced incarnation that can not only speak but also visually express the narrative.
