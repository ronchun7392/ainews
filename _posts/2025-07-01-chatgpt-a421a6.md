OpenAI announced an upgrade of its advanced voice Advanced Voices functionality, which significantly increased the naturality and fluidity of voice interactions, and made the dialogue between users and ChatGPT more easy, making it possible for users to communicate with the models as if they were talking with the real person.
More importantly, the updated version enhances voice translation. Users can talk directly to ChatGPT in multiple rounds, and the model can continue to translate without repeated hints until the user has given a clear stop order.
The update has been made available to all paying users.
 
♪ The voice is more like a real person ♪

- ** The tone is more natural**: AI is no longer speaking in plain words, but with ups and downs, with emphasis.

- ** Rhythm is more real**: A natural pause** and ** accent treatment** was included in the speech, which doesn't sound like a robot.

- ** More emotional expression**: e.g.:
You can hear **Empathy**, like "I understand how you feel" is no longer mechanical.

**Sarcasm**, such as “Of course, it's your best idea” has changed dramatically.

# ** Instant voice translation**

- ChatGPT can now act as a “bilingual translator” in voice conversations** e.g.:
You speak English and it is translated immediately into the Portuguese-language dialogue.

- He speaks Portuguese, he translates back to you in English.

** There is no need to repeat the opening** and it can be translated on a continuous basis until you say “stop translating”.
The applicable scenarios include:** international travel, telecommuting, multilingual collaboration**.

# ** Method of use**

- This feature has been rolled out to all platforms** (Web, iOS, Android, desktop).

- Click " Voice icon " to start in the dialogue input area.

- The system will enable the latest version of the voice engine to automatically support language recognition and translation.

# # Known limits

- Certain voice options may result in a slight decline in sound** and occasional instability in tone/speak speed.

- ** In very few cases** speech patterns may be “phantomized” to produce unanticipated content, such as background music, murmurs or ads.

- Officially, these anomalies are being continuously repaired to improve consistency and user experience.
