AI Research announced that the system of “ artificial scientists” developed by them **Zochi**,** has been independently completed from topic selection to experiment to complete scientific process of writing and contributing** and that its results - a research paper on multiple rounds of escape attacks - have been officially accepted by the ACL 2025 conference**.

- **Zochi is a system of artificial scientists developed by Intology** and became the first AI system** to adopt the ACL draft autonomously**.

- It can automatically do literature overviews, topic selection, methodological innovation, experimental design and validation, paper writing

- ACL is the highest international conference in the field of natural language processing, with a main intake rate of about 20 per cent, with a high level of technical depth, innovation and experimental integrity**.

- Zochi's thesis Tempest received a meta-review rating of 4, in the top 8.2%.

The study Tempest, published by Zochi, shows how language models can be “relaxed” step by step through natural dialogue, and ends with what should have been banned. Tempest has a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo, 97% on GPT-4, surpassing existing methods.
The study revealed not only the gaps in language model security mechanisms, but also the strength of AI's autonomous scientific research.

#Zochi research process architecture
Zochi is not a non-traditional “AI assistant” but an independent agent (agent) with an end-to-end scientific research capability.

# 1.  Documentation autoanalyzing

- Swallow thousands of papers and build knowledge maps automatically

- Determining current research bottlenecks and development pathways

- Specially good at discovering the hidden connections** across literature**

##2.  Research direction selected

- The initial input is only "researched in general directions" (e.g., LLM escape attack)

- System-owned identification** of specific research issues** and methodological pathways

- In this study, Zochi focuses on the combination of "multicycle escape + tree search strategy"

#3.  Experimental design and automated validation

- Automation of experimental programmes, preparation of test scripts

- Standard data sets are fixed throughout the process, resulting in more repossibility

- Multiple rounds of parallel testing have significantly increased the speed of validation:** the full project cycle will only take a few days**

# 4.  Writing and submission of papers

- Automatically writing the entire paper (including summaries, methods, experiments, conclusions)

- Humans are only involved in chart production, formatting and citation

- Zochi is not listed as author, only uses the system in the thanks component

# Overview of the contents of this published paper (ACL 2025)

# # Thesis title:
** Termest: Automatic Multi-Turn Jailbreaing of Range Language Models with TreSearch**

# The question of research:
How to design a more efficient ** multi-cycle escape method (multi-turn Jailbreak)** and break through the dialogue security restrictions of large language models (e.g. GPT-4).

## Method: Tempest (tree search + dialogue optimization)
Zochi proposed a new approach called **Tempest**:
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/78gmhdgixby1g8cuzpenr85iymg5)➡️ 简而言之：Tempest通过模拟自然对话，用多个阶段的提问逐步“绕过”语言模型的安全限制，比传统的“一句话攻击”更有效。

# The results of the experiment:
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/7d9yic8cy0k9x2533oigczvhnga0)
- Tempest is not only more successful** but also less efficient** using fewer queries;

- Experimental methods are complete and rigorous and include comparison experiments, digestion experiments and multi-model tests.

# The meaning of research:

- To reveal the risk of a “step-by-step compromise” in the dialogue security strategy of the large-language model**;

- New analytical tools and ideas were provided for the security protection of language models;

- The provision of a methodological framework to help design stronger defence mechanisms.

# Why is this a landmark breakthrough?
** For the first time, AI independently adopted the A* conference manuscript**

- ACL is one of the most authoritative global meetings in the field of natural language processing; Zochi became the first AI to adopt its official draft.

** “Automated scientific research” closed **

- In the past, AI had been able only to support the preparation of summaries or the collation of data, and now Zochi has the ability to ** raise new scientific issues and solve them**.

** Efficient quality**

- The entire research cycle, from conception to the completion of the paper, takes only a few days**, which is dozens of times faster than traditional human researchers.

** Research depths are hard**

- Zochi ' s thesis received a final score of 4 points, ranking among the top 8.2 per cent of the contributions, exceeding the majority of human authors.

# Zochi's next direction

#  Beta project release:
The Infology programme, which publishes Zochi to the public, is phased in:
** Partners in scientific research model** (initial phase):

- Assistance in the selection of topics, preparation of proposals for the Fund, design experiments, preparation of general papers, etc.;

- Greater emphasis on teamwork with human researchers.

** Autonomous scientific model** (later):

- Complete automated research capacity, gradually opening up its full-process functionality.
