ElevenLabs released **Conversation AI 2.0**, compared to 1.0 in the last four months, representing a major leap in its voice agency platform, with the goal of building the most advanced, credible and customized AI voice agent system**. The upgrade covers natural language processing, cross-linguistic dialogue, knowledge integration, scalable architecture, security compliance, etc. and significantly enhances functionality and credibility in the business landscape.
** Bright spot function**
** It's not embarrassing. ** It can understand when you're stopping, when you're thinking, and it won't interrupt you.
** Multilingual is smooth**: you speak Chinese, it speaks Chinese; you speak Spanish, and it automatically changes.
** The answer is more “know-how”**: it can answer you directly from your company's knowledge base.
** Bulk calls are unsolicited**: hundreds of thousands of clients who can be notified by the system on a one-time basis.
** A model tube interacts in two ways**: no separate text and voice versions, no labour effort.

# Core improvements bright spots

#1 **1  Mechanisms for naturalized dialogue**

- The natural “rotation talk” system (Natural Turn-Taking) uses ** real-time analysis of speech rhythms and pause signals (e.g. “um” “ah”)** to determine when to wait and when to respond and to avoid interrupting user or unnatural waiting, making dialogue more like a real human exchange.
Example: When the client says, "Let me just check... um... " AI will be smart to wait, not respond immediately.

##2.**  Multilingual recognition and seamless switching**

- The Integrated Language Testing system does not require predefined language configurations, AI automatically detects the language used by users and responds in the same language to achieve ** the uninterrupted, multilingual dialogue experience**. Especially suitable for the customer service and sales system for users worldwide.

##**3.  Integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented General)**

- ** uniquely structured integration RAG models** to enable AI to retrieve the latest information from the designated knowledge base** to generate responses.

- Characteristics:
** Low-delayed access**: almost real-time response.

- ** High level of privacy protection**: data are not disclosed and suitable for sensitive scenarios such as medical, financial, legal etc.

Example of application:

- Medical assistants ask for updated treatment standards.

- After-sale system acquisition of product manual content.

##4.  Multimodel proxy support (Multimodal Agent)

- The same proxy definition to support ** text + voice ** two-channel output.

- To avoid duplication of creation of voice bot / text bot and to improve the efficiency of the project, applying to scenarios that require multiple interactive channels.

##5. # # Batch Calling

- Allowing the use of voice agents** to launch a large number of outreach missions at the same time**

- Applied scene:
Automatic Notification Sending

- Client satisfaction survey

- Invitation to the event

Strengths: More efficient, harmonized information and reduced labour burden.

# Enterprise-level trust mechanisms and compliance design
