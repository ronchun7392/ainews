Google released **Gemini 2.5 Pro (I/ O preview)**, a model update for the forthcoming Google I/O Congress, which was issued in advance and focused on upgrading coding-related capabilities, particularly in the areas of front-end development, UI construction, function calls, video understanding of integration code generation.

# Main updates:

- ** Significant improvement in code capability**
Better support function calls, module re-engineering, logical judgement

- Structured understanding of “senior developers”

** Frontend and UI development capability upgrade**

- WebDev Arena, number one.

- Auto-generated beauty and well-structured web components (including CSS, responsive layout)

- To recognize design styles and keep them consistent

** Video understanding + code generation integration**

- Video content  Interactive application (based on YouTube content)

- Multimodular AI Capability Enhancement (VideoMME 84.8%)

** Designed to apply faster landing speed**

- Available App for quick-generated UI+ action from simple hints

- Example: Dietation Starter App

**Experience optimization**

- Reduction in error rate, increase in function trigger rate

- Compatibility with the old version interface, constant price, seamless upgrade


# Detailed upgrades

# 1.  ** Code upgrade**

- Greater code generation and re-engineering:
In an evaluation involving complex backend re-engineering tasks,** the abstract and structural selection capabilities of the “senior developer” level were demonstrated for the first time successfully through the Senior Developer Assessment for Cognition**;

- For complex business logic adjustments, modular design, API rewriting, etc.

More reliable function call capability (Function Calling):

- ** Error rate drops, trigger rate increases** and developers can more easily construct a "Agentic Workflow" based on a combination of multi-step functions;

- Developers of Gemini API access do not need to migrate and the system is automatically switched to a new version.

##2.  Front-end development support for overall enhancement**
Gemini 2.5 Pro has leapfroged to **WebDev Arena's number one ** in the front-end development field (the ranking for measuring human preferences).
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/0k7vhicgwgv2nwefdl3g8e644ctg)可用于以下典型任务：

- Conversion of the design to the actual web component (HTML + CSS + JS);

- Rapid generation of UI components and automatic adaptation to existing styles;

- Understanding the visual elements of button interactions, fonts, margins, animations, etc., and restoring them to high-quality web pages;

- Imitation of existing applications to achieve new functions (e.g. embedding video players in existing web pages).

Example: In Gemini 95 Starter App, the developers simply describe " want to add a uniform video player", and Gemini can read the existing design style automatically and generate usable components.

##3.  Video+code: further integration of multi-model capabilities**

- A high score on the VideoMME benchmark of **84.8 per cent**, which is one of the leading “large models of video understanding” at present;

- An interactive learning application may be generated automatically on the basis of a YouTube video**, including content extraction, interface construction and logical generation;

- On behalf of AI, it has evolved from a language-driven code to a multi-model phase of a video-driven product.

Example: Video to Learing App of Google AI Studio demonstrates this new capability.

##4.  Development process acceleration from conception to product**
With Gemini 2.5 Pro, developers can quickly realize a product idea as an App with complete functionality and visual quality.
Example product: “Dictation Starter App”:

- Auto-generated** microphone animations, responsive layouts, button suspension effects**;

- A high degree of professionalism in visual performance, not only in meeting functional needs;

- Demonstrate the basic aesthetic perception and product awareness of the model.

Now you can use Gemini API in Google AI Studio to select Gemini 2.5 Pro (05-06) to build with Vertex AI.

- The current Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is open for use at the same price as the old version (03-25)**;

- The system has implicitly pointed the interface to the new version (05-06) and the developers do not need to migrate;

- Model cards have been updated in a synchronized manner to record the details of the upgrades.
