**Shortcut** is an AI tool platform designed to automate **Excel's work**. It allows users to tell AI in natural language what they want to do in Excel, and Shortcut automatically completes these form tasks, like an AI Excel assistant.
It can understand what you're saying, and then it does it like an Excel expert, for example:

- Data calculation, aggregation

- A visual.

- Cleaning the data.

- Making charts.

- Formulate.

- Autofill Cells

- Format adjustments, etc.

It solves the case of Excel and the Financial Model World Cup at ten times the speed of the human champion.
Shortcut functions are almost identical to Excel, and you can open existing Excel files to operate or export them, and you can do most of the work with one key and then come back to see the results.

Step 2: Import or create a new Excel file
You can upload your own .xx file, or click **New File** to create a new empty workbook.
Step 3: Enter task command in dialogue box
For example:

- “Statistics of total sales in different countries”

- "Find records of orders above 1000"

- “Transfer all first column text to capital letters”

- “Draw a line chart showing trends in profits”

Step 4: AI auto-execut and update tables
You see the table changes instantaneously, the calculations are complete, the chart is generated,** you do not need to operate any functional bar**.

# Applies to the crowd

- ** Untechnical staff**: No formula, but those who need to process large amounts of data

- ** Finance, sales, operators**: Excel is used daily but tasks are duplicated

- **Liberal & Regulatory **: Desire to save PV operating time

- ** Students and researchers**: tasks such as data analysis, table cleaning, etc.

# Case:
Shortcut was able to complete a full day of work by professional lawyers in less than 10 minutes, cleaning, editing and analysing data faster than humans.
By analysing 5,000 rows of CSV data from all Y Combinator companies, it not only quickly provided insights, but also created charts and dashboards. Research shows that most companies are still operating, mainly B2B, but consumer markets are more successful. Shortcut is now up to 80% of human work on Excel, and its capacity is constantly improving.
